## About this repository

I am running a 5e campaign and one of my player's characters is obsessed with flora of the region. I wanted an easy way to roll for random plants with interesting effects so I converted everything to Markdown and made tables that will help make this super quick and easy when combined with [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd) and the [Dice Roller Plugin](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller)
