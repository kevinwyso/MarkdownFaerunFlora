## About this repository

I am running a 5e campaign and one of my player's characters is obsessed with flora of the region. I wanted an easy way to roll for random plants with interesting effects so I converted everything to Markdown and made tables that will help make this super quick and easy when combined with [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd) and the [Dice Roller Plugin](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller)

## Examples of using these files in Obsidian with the Dice Roller Plugin

```
`dice: [[Faerun Flora#^arctice-very-common]]|Plant`
```

Roll a random plant from the *Desert* **Biome** with a *Legendary* **Rarity**

```
`dice: [[Faerun Flora#^desert-legendary]]|Plant`
```

Roll a random plant from the *Cities* **Biome** with a *Rare* **Rarity**
