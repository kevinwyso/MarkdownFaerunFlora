biome: Underdark/Caves
---
Thick black weed native to the Underdark that propagates via tiny seeds. On the surface it appears as 1-foot diamater clumps, but its roots extend in a 50 ft diamater just beneath the surface. Natural healing is prevented when standing above its roots, and magical healing only heals half the normal HP. If the clump is pulled out, the plant survives and regrows the clump in 1d4 days. Only digging up the whole root system or the use of a Blight-type spell can truly kill it. Has taint-mechanic boosting effects.
