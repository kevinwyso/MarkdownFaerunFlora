A tall tree growing in warmer plain environments with large, sharp thorns on the branches and small, oval shaped leaves. The acacia has long been associated with rituals surrounding the burying and preservation of the dead, and as well as in rituals designed to contact and speak with the dead. If acacia is combined with a solution of melted iron and poured into the hand of a person who is has recently died, the time period in which Raise Dead works is increased to a period of 30 days instead of 10.
