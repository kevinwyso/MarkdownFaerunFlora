The herb has one leaf which grows from a stalk about three inches from the ground. Its appearance gives it its name. The leaf must be boiled in olive oil and set in the sun for three days. At the end of that time the infusion can be used as a balm for wounds. In the event that the wound is infected the balm will draw out the infection within one day. However, for that one day the damage caused by the infection will be twice as severe, infection damage can be determined by the DM. If the wound is not infected the balm will increase the rate of healing by 1 hp for that day, adding +1 to any hit points regained during a short rest.
