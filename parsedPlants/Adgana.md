The leaves of this plant must be dried. They may then be crushed and eaten. Its effects diminish with constant use. The first time and second time Adgana is used it adds 2 to the user's Strength, Dexterity and Constitution for 2d4+4 minutes. The third time it is used it adds 1 to Strength and Dexterity for the same amount of time, the 4th time +1 is added to Strength only, and after that no benefit is ever gained. In addition to this, the herb is also highly addictive, meaning that after the first and second used, the user must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or become addicted. This DC increases by +1 for each additional use, and addiction causes a -1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until next consumption of Adgana.
