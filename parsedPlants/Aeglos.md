A tall, slightly thorny plant with a large, white, sweet-smelling flower and a strong root system. When boiled in salt water, the roots can be used as a combat stimulant. When a creature drinks the infusion, at the beginning of their next turn they gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class if they are wearing no armor or light armor, which lasts for 3d10 minutes. This herb has no effect when used again on the creature until the creature completes a short rest.
