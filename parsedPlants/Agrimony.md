Agrimony reaches a height of 1 to 2 feet. It has leaves up to seven inches long, which are serrated, green on top and white underneath. It has yellow flowers with five petals which are arranged in a spike on top of the stem. A successful application will cure sprains and bruises in half the normal time. Agrimony was also believed to produce very heavy sleep if placed beneath a person’s head, so deep that the person could not be woken until it was removed, up to the DM’s discretion.
