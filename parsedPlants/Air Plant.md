A sponge-like pond-surface plant that produces and stores air. A fist-sized piece can be held in the mouth to provide a medium creature with 5 minutes of air before the plant wilts and the recipient is back to normal breathing conditions for whatever the environment determines. Air Plant works underwater, in clouds of poison or dangerous spores, sandstorms, and other similar conditions.
