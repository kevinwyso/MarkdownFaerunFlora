Alchemilla is a fairly uncommon ground cover plant, used sometimes as an ornamental on the property of the wealthy. The plant has ornate, cup-like leaves notable for catching and collecting beautiful beads of dew, and its small yellow flower that blooms in the late summer. According to legend, alchemists of old used to harvest the drops of dew and rain that would collect on these leaves for use in alchemical processes of turning base metals into gold. Although this is no longer common practice, Alchemilla is still commonly used as a tea or herbal supplement to help with feminine health.
