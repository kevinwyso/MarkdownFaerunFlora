Eating a handful of these orange berries will add +1 to both a character’s chance to hit, and to their damage rolls for 2d6 minutes. The berries can be brewed in white wine to produce a drink that will add +2 to the recipient’s chance to hit, and grant 2d4 temporary hit points until expended. This effect lasts for 2d12 minutes, and ends with the characters total collapse for 1d3 days unless they successfully save against poison (DC 15 Cons.). This brew will only be useful for one month after manufacture and then loses its potency.
