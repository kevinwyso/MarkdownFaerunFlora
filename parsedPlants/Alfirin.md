biome: Deserts

A bell-shaped flower that blooms during the night in desert environments from small, dry-looking desert scrub. The nectar of the flower has a syrup-like consistency and drinking this syrup as an action gives the recipient resistance to force, lightning, and radiant damage which lasts for a full hour. In addition, the creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature gains vulnerability to necrotic and psychic damage for the same period of time.
