When all-heale is mixed in a pint of olive oil and applied to a wound, (one application per day), the recipient will heal even if still working as normal, meaning that serious injuries wonâ€™t interfere with intense physical activity. With rest, the recipient will heal at 1.5 times normal rate, meaning that half of all hit points recovered in a short rest can be added to the total hit points.
