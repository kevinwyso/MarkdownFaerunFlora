Growing in the cold north, this scraggly and thorny bush endures extreme hardships, and only blossoms for a few short weeks during the year. The sparse leaves of the plant are large and waxy, and point upward toward the sun. While some of the bush remains above ground, the majority of the plant is an extensive root system that spreads far and deep beneath the earth. Brewing the dried root into a strong and bitter tea creates a drink that staves off the cold, and is a much sought-after drink in the harsh climate of the Dalelands, granting a +1 bonus on any saving throws against cold weather or cold based damage for the next hour.
