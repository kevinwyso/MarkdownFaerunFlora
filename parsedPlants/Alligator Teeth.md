A rough bush that primarily inhabits rocky regions, and grows to about the height of a man and similar in diameter. The stalk of the plant is covered in sharp white thorns, providing the plantâ€™s namesake. Villagers often cultivate rows of the plant outside town borders as a measure of safety from beasts, monsters, or other attackers of low intelligence. Spiders also seem overly attracted to the bush. It is rare to see such a bush without the glimmer of webbing in between the thorny branches.
