Alor is a gnarled tree with broad, spiky leaves often growing to 40 feet-tall or more. The bark of the Alor peels readily and can be easily shredded by hand. Mixing the shredded bark with any liquid provides a poultice that can be used for simple healing. 2 minutes after applying the poultice to the creature's wounds, the creature regains 1 hit point. This herb has no effect when used again on the creature until the creature completes a short rest.
