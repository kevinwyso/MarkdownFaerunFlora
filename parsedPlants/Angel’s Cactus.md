This barrel shaped cactus sprouts a pair of symmetrical leaves that are broad and flattened, giving an appearance much like “wings”. The cactus is covered by tapered yellow thorns, often giving the cactus an appearance of having a golden aura. In the cooler months, the cactus sprouts clusters of small white flowers. Tapping the water contained within the cactus and distilling it over a period of months creates an interesting tasting wine. Those drinking it say that it tastes fruity, but with a touch of something they can’t quite place. This wine is often called “Angel Wine,” and is sold by Shaarmid merchants throughout Faerun. Whether or not the “touch of something else” comes from tainting from the merchants or is an innate flavor of the cactus is yet to be decided.
