A low to the ground desert succulent with small, ovular leaves and very small red flowers that bloom shortly before rainfall, a good indicator of when rain is coming to desert locales. When the sap of the Arkasu plant is applied to wounds, it doubles the rate of healing, adding +4 to hit points regained during a short rest. The effect is not cumulative.
