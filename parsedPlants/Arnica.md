This plant grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet. It has a hairy stem on which its leaves are arranged in pairs, and in summer months, produces large, ball-shaped orange flowers. These flowers should be plucked and dried, and then boiled in a litre of beer. This resulting mixture should be applied to a compress which is wrapped around a bruise. A successful application will cause the bruise to fade within one day. The pollen of the flowers if inhaled will cause uncontrollable sneezing. A phial of arnica carried in a personâ€™s pocket is also reputed to help a person quit smoking.
