An unusual, woody-stemmed plant dappled brown and white. The roots are very shallow in soil and extend upwards at straight angles to form a teepee like structure at the base of the plant. The stem can be dried and ground and then mixed with oil to create a frothy polishing oil that can add a +1 to a weaponâ€™s damage without the use of magic of craftwork for a full day.
