Originating from the elemental plane of fire, Ash Willow is a dark red tree that can grow to over 120 ft tall. It thrives off of heat, often growing from pools of lava or on top of dormany volcanoes. They continuously rain ash around them, producing 1 lb per day per 10 ft of its height. It extends runner roots that spawn 1d3 new tree each month. They create areas of large trees with naturally burning leaves that are only contained by the rainy jungle environment.
