Ashline is a small red flower, with very pale green leaves. The entire plant must be mashed and boiled in red wine costing greater than 15 gp for one week and the resultant mixture mixed with olive oil. When this liquid is poured over a petrified person it will, on a successful medicine check, restore them to their normal state.
