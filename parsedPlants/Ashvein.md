Standing between 6 and 8 feet high, with glossy leaves and twisting, contorted branches, the Ashvein Tree is most notable for its thin, papery bark. New growth leaves on an Ashvein begin as a light blue-grey that slowly darkens into a rich charcoal, giving the trees a distinctive pattern. After the bark reaches a certain age it begins to crack and peel away from the trunk. If the dark grey bark is boiled in water for three hours, then dried and crushed, it creates a powder that completely neutralizes the flavor and odor of anything blended with the bark as it is crushed, possibly making the plant appropriate for use with poisons or perhaps just bad tasting food. Wood from the Ashvein is exceptionally light weight and releases large amounts of acrid smoke when burned.
