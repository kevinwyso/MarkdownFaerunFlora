A small ground plant growing from a large tuber a few inches under the soil that grows as ground cover in many jungles. The name Ashwaganda comes from an ancient phrase meaning “horse’s strength.” The tubers can be cut up and dried and used as horse feed, granting horses increased movement speed (+15) and increased carry weight (+50).
