Aspens are tall, slim trees that typically grow in large clonal groups, constantly propagating from one original mother plant, similar to the sable fir. Aspens have long been considered a gift from the Fae, and so have developed quite a superstitious following. Crowns of green Aspen wood are commonly placed upon the heads of those to be buried in burial mounds, as is the tradition in some places, are though to ensure easy passage to the afterlife or a guarantee at being reborn into the next life more quickly. An Aspen leaf placed under the tongue while sleeping is thought to make the bearer more eloquent. And to some, Aspen has long been a treatment for fears and apprehensions when applied as oil extracts. Whether or not any of this is true is debatable, but some will put superstition before what the can see as proof.
