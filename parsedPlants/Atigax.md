The roots of this plant must be brewed over a low fire for one day, and the resulting distillation drunk. If used successfully, sight will be protected from glare or blinding light (as from the Blinding Flash spell or abnormally bright surroundings) for a period of nine hours. This herb can thus be used to limit the ill effects suffered by subterranean creatures (such as drow) in full sunlight.
