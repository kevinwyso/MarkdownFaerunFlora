The flowers can be eaten whole by any goodaligned character to receive a +3 bonus to attack rolls against fiends and aberrations and advantage on Wisdom saves against fear for 2d8 hours. A non-good-aligned character that consumes the flower instead takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls against fiends and aberrations and disadvantage on Wisdom saves against fear.
