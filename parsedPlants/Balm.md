Balm is a plant about 2 to 3 feet tall with squarish stems. It has oval, serrated leaves. It has small flowers which can be any shade from white to blue, which form small clusters at the base of the leaves. It reputedly has properties of bestowing longevity and uses as an aphrodisiac, and so could be used as an ingredient in "Potions of Longevity" as well as love potions.
