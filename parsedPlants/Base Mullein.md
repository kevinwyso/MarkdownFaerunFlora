Base Mullein is very easily found due to the fact that its flower stalks often obtain a height of 8 feet or more and its leaves are fuzzy and soft. Its small, yellow flowers cover about 3 feet of the top of the stalk in a spike and form a long funnel about an inch or two in diameter. If the leaves of this herb are applied to a burn within one hour, it will heal for half of the damage taken from the burn.
