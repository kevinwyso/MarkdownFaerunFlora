A short stalk-flower ending in a large, purple head of calices pointing in all directions. Commonly used in teas and tinctures, the leaves have a sweet lemony-and-minty taste, and can help with digestive health. According to legend, the plant was commonly offered as sacrifice and appeasement in rituals involving the contact of divines, and is still sought after by some monks and religious sects for this purpose.
