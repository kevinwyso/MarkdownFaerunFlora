A leafy evergreen tree, the trunks grow about as round as a man can reach, and their boughs are often fashioned into brooms by common people. The seeds hold another use, and are often ground into a fine powder called Green Sleeping Dust. The dust is primarily used by mercenaries in service to the royal family of Pentillia and as a sleeping drug in higher society. When this powder is inhaled, it forces a target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 2d6 minutes. If the drug is willingly consumed, the target does not have to make this throw and instead just falls unconscious.
