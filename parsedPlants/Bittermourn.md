A rare, colorless lichen that grows on rocks beneath year-round ice. When crushed and strained, it creates a clear gel at freezing temperatures that melts into liquid when warmer. Imbibing a pint slows the aging process and grants a lifespan of twice normal length. If imbibed by someone during near-death or immediately after death, will place the person into a deep magical coma and/or reduce the cost of a resurrection spell, up to the DMâ€™s discretion.
