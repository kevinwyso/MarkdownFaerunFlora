Resembling actual corn, but in far miniature, the plants generally grow on the edges of swamps and other humid areas. Unlike corn, it is overly difficult to cultivate and farm, which attributes to the rarity of the plant. Upon ripening, small ears of violet and coal colored corn stand upon the tips of the plant stalks. Eating the kernels provides a bitter taste to those willing to try it. However, the vegetable is prized not for eating, but for making a sweet alcohol called Blackcorn Whiskey that has a strong flavor of plums. Due to the heavy alcohol content, it is often mixed with fruit juices. A more potent version of the brew is often distilled by dwarves, but such a process takes considerably longer, and is worth up to 75 gold per bottle.
