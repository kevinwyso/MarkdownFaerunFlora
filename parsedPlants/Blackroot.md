A thin vine that has small dark leaves, the vine predominantly grows underground near lakes and pools. The vine generally grows in places where a small bit of light occurs, sometimes thriving off of the glow provided by phosphorescent moss. Blackroot's roots can be applied to fresh wounds in order to promote quick healing (applied immediately, gives 1d4 back to character at once) while the leaves can be crushed into the powder known as blackroot poison. Those injured by a blade coated in the poison must succeed at a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 16 (4d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour. Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they are Paralyzed for 1d6 minutes.
