A dark red or burgundy flower with black-veined dark-green leaves that commonly grows in small bunches from decaying organic matter, commonly growing from corpses of animals and people. Black Vein Flowers can be turned into the aptly named Black Vein Poison which, after ingestion or injury exposure, will begin to poison the recipient, turning the victimâ€™s blood to a toxic black ichor as it works its way through the system. The target must make a DC 12 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the target will take 2d8 Necrotic damage, and be poisoned for 1d6 hours. During the duration of poisoning, the target will also have a temporary -2 penalty to Constitution. On a successful save, the target will only take half the necrotic damage and not be poisoned.
