A short plant that grows deep in the jungle, the stalks are covered with long pointed leaves. The plant also blossoms red flowers that appear to be similar to roses. Unearthing the plant reveals a massive crimson root that has a faint coppery scent. Many people seek out the plant for the root, which is said to ensure robust fortitude in those that consume it. Upon consuming the bloodroot, a living person must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be Paralyzed for 1 minute. Immediately afterward the creature gains a +2 bonus to their Constitution saving throws for 1d4 hours. Although the initial rush of blood throughout the body causes people to become momentarily stunned, it is often still complimented for the other effects, which some say causes increased virility. What few know is that the root is also sought after by vampires, as it causes increased effects to their undead physiology. Many such creatures take steps to covertly acquire the plant. A vampire consuming the bloodroot immediately gains Advantage on Charisma based skill checks for the next 1d4 hours, and the herb causes them to immediately Rage (as per the Barbarian class feature) if they smell blood.
