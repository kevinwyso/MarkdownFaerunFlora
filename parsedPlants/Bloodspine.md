A succulent plant growing in rocky soil, a cluster of thick leaves reach upward toward the sky, their edges covered in sharp thorns and the tips bearing a single crimson spine. Interestingly, the plant secretes a slight poison from these spines which may cause paralysis in small animals or the infirm. Those with hardier constitutions seek out the poison, as it provides a slight euphoric effect in addition to the paralysis. The poison requires only a DC 5 Constitution save, or the injured will suffer complete paralysis for 1d4 hours. Those that succeed at the saving throw notice a slight euphoric effect for the same amount of time.
