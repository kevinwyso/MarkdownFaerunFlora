A small, leafy herb that is often found in gullies and ravines in arid regions and foothills. The herb has bright green leaves, and smells faintly like honey crossed with fresh rainfall. Grinding up the plant creates a powder that can be used on open wounds to quickly cause bleeding to slow or stop. Applying the herb to a bleeding wound grants the recipient recovery of 1 hit point and makes the recipient immune to bleed damage for 1d4 hours.
