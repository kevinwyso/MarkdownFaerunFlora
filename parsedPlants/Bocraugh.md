Bocraugh is a colossal truffle-like fungus that can be distilled down to a sticky black paste (one large truffle to produce 1 fl. Oz. of paste) causing any type of seed to grow to full maturity within 1d4 minutes. This applies to trees, herbs, plant creatures, and even plants that take hundreds of years to bloom.
