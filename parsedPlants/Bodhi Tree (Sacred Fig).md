According to legend, the bodhi tree was once the spiritual home of a persistent monk seeking enlightenment. The monk sat under this tree and meditated for close to seven years, surviving only on the tree’s collected water droplets and on the tree’s bounty of figs. After learning of this monk’s quest for enlightenment, a corrupt king wanted in on this understanding of everything and wanted it only for himself, and ordered the tree destroyed. The roots were hacked at with swords and glaives and major limbs felled with large axes. All the while, the monk sat beneath the tree and still meditated. When the king’s servants had finished their destruction, the monk retrieved a bottle of sacramental wine from his bag and fed it to the tree’s damaged roots, vowing that if the tree should die, so would he. Upon the completion of this vow, the tree’s roots absorbed the wine and began to repair themselves at an incredibly rate, and the tree grew larger and lusher than it had been before. The location of the original tree has been lost to the ages, but cuttings of the tree have been transplanted to many of the major monasteries of the realm as a symbol of divine power and belief.
