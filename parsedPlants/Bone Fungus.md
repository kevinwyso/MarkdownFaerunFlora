Bulbous ivory-colored fungus that releases a 10 ft cloud of spores, in the presence of motion, that work as an inhaled poison (DC Constitution 15, 1d8-1 poison damage). If damage is taken, bone density is reduced, resulting in extra damage from bludgeoning in the form of an extra space for criticals against you (19 or 20 counts as a crit). The fungi are immune to acid and thunder, destroyed by cold or radiant damage, fire and electricity also destroy but release spores. Recovery from the reduced bone density is only capable in the consumption of magically created potions and through Lesser Restoration spells.
