biome: Swamps

Typically found in swamps and marshes growing in patches with a radius of up to 300 ft. A successful Sleight of Hand check allows you to pick one, but it renders them inert. If unsuccessfully picked, explodes as if from an Arcane Explosion spell. Always regrow in the same spot 10 days after triggering or any other attempt to purge them.
