Resembling Blackcorn in miniature, Brawler’s Blackcorn is a hardy plant that grows without light in dark cave environs. The kernels of this corn can be dried and ground and mixed into hard liquors, typically a bourbon (Brawler’s Bourbon). Brawler’s Bourbon is typically used by cheating gamblers to give themselves an unfair advantage. Ingesting the bourbon makes the user immune to its secondary properties, and so cheating brawlers may take a swig of the bourbon and spill some on their hands. The poison works as a contact toxin that will then weaken the opponent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The target must make a DC 14 Cons. Save vs poison or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature is then also knocked unconscious for the same amount of time. The target can be woken if they take damage or are shaken awake by another person. On a successful save, the target is then immune to the poison’s effects for 12 hours.
