Brethil Trees are a narrow evergreen that grow to heights of around 40 feet. With fan-shaped fronds of needles, the tree has a rough, deep-brown bark that can be scraped off in small sections with a knife. With proper preparation, the bark can be steeped in boiling water to create a dark brown, murky infusion. When a creature drinks the infusion, at the beginning of their next turn the charmed and frightened conditions are removed from them if applicable.
