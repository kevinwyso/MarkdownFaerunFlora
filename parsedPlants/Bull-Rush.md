Bull-rushes are tall straight stemmed plants with many small flowers at the top of the stalk. These flowers must be ground into an ointment which is applied to a personâ€™s eyes or tongue. This herb will put someone to sleep for 3d12 hours on a successful medicine check. A roll of 1 on the check will instead put the person into a coma.
