Cachuga Peppers can only be found on growing in or around plains that are home to hot springs or geysers. Cachuga peppers are vaguely pyramidal shaped woody bushes with profuse foliage that bear clusters of small, fragrant yellow blooms which eventually give way to fiery peppers of a marbled red-orange. The bushes bloom continually in the tropical climes of the Swordfish Islands causing Cachuga bushes to produce large numbers of these firey peppers. The peppers themselves are 2-4 inches long and hang from the bushes by thick, green, vein-like structures. Cachuga Peppers are exceptionally spicy and flavorful, and the skin of these peppers is leathery and can be mashed into a paste, then shaped and dried into chips or a flavorful yet non-spicy paper-like wrapping, pairing nicely with raw fish. The peppers dry well, retaining their fire and flavor for exceptional periods of time, and their seeds can be ground into a powder that causes *severe* eye and skin irritation (DC 16 Cons. Save or blindness for 3d10 minutes).
