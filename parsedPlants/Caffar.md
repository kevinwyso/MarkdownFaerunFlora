A small, brown nut that grows from short, green, leafy understory plants in tropical forests, typically ground into powder and brewed into a dark, sweet-smelling beverage, traditionally with a goat's milk base. The drink is renowned by shaman and psionics for its boon to their all-seeing abilities. (+1 to all wisdom checks until the next long rest. If more than three cups are imbibed, causes a -2 to rolls to hit as the imbiber is too jumpy and caffeinated to focus.)
