biome: Jungles and Deserts
---
A fragrant bush that grows in the dense jungle and sparse desert, the veined leaves and branches are a pale green, and the plant appears to strive to reach upward toward the canopy above. At the end of each branch are clusters of small white flowers or berries, depending on the time of year. The small white berries that the plant produces are actually quite poisonous (Those that ingest the berries must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw vs poison or suffer 32 (8d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1d6 hours. If the target succeeds the saving throw, they only suffer half damage with no poisoning). Local tribes avoid the berries unless they are using them to coat their arrowheads and blowgun darts (Adds +2 poison damage to successful attacks made using a blowgun).
