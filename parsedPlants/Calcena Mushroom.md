Anyone who breathes in the spores of one of these small, pink mushrooms incurs a -3 penalty on all Wisdom saves vs illusions for 2d12 hours. The mushroom may be brewed into a potion by brewing tea and leaving the mushroom to stand in the tea for 2 weeks. The resultant concoction when drunk is a powerful hallucinogen. Anyone under the influence of it will see whatever the DM wants them to see. This effect lasts for 1d4 hours in which the player enters a trance and responds lazily to interaction with other characters or NPCâ€™s.
