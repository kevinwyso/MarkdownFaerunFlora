A twisted and tough vine that grows in rocky crags high in the mountains, the waxy leaves of the plant are small and grow in clumps. Small white flowers grow on the vines, which turn into light blue berries which are quite tart. Dwarves send their children out to pick the berries, so that they may be harvested into a specialty wine and jams. Those drinking the wine often have an unfounded and untrue feeling of invincibility, while those consuming the jam often feel satiated and satisfied with their meal.
