A somewhat stubborn vine plant that grows in open fields and along forest paths with a knack for regrowth. Every attempt to hack at the plant with any form of bladed instrument causes an increase in the vineâ€™s length and girth. Traditionally the plant grows very slowly, only gaining an inch or so in length and thickness annually, but with enough hacking and slashing, the vine can prove to be an incredible pest to farmers and travllers.
