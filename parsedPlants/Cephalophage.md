A pale, fleshy fungus with a tough, rubbery consistency that is commonly found growing near carnivorous plants. The fungus grows upon corpses, absorbing the cadaver's life memories and personality; up to 10 different minds have been found absorbed by one cephalophage mushroom. Eating cephalophage will transfer those memories and personality quirks to the eater. (Effects last 1d4 hours and while they last the eater can access all of the dead person's mind. After the effects wear off, the eater may still succumb on occasion to "flashbacks" or personality instability; when under intense stress or in a situation liable to cause such flashbacks, the user must make a roll of under their intelligence modifier or be overcome with memories of another personâ€™s life.) This plant is condemned by some religions as unholy, believed to prevent a soul/spirit from attaining the afterlife and possibly in creating undead.
