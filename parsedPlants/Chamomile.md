This plant can grow up to 2 feet tall, and has a branched stem. It has few leaves, and these are finely divided. The flower heads have yellow centres which are domed in shape with a hollow cavity at their very center. The petals of this plant bend backwards towards the stem. The flowers from a single plant must be immersed in boiling water and the resultant drink consumed. This drink is very bitter and is normally mixed with honey, but this is not fully necessary. The drink will last for approximately 2 months after manufacture, while the leaves can be dried, and will then keep for up to three years. A successful use of this herb will have a calming effect on the consumer, commonly used as a minor sleep aid.
