biome: Underdark/Caves and Swamps
---
Bright yellow mold native to caves and swamps, commonly found in patches that devour air, creating localized vacuums (can cause air-tight space to collapse inwards). Creatures within 5 ft of a patch begin to suffocate as breatheable air is pulled away from them, and within 10 feet of these patches, flames begin to sputter and go out.
