Growing on rotting wood in moist climates, this black fungus is generally avoided by those gathering firewood. While the fungus is highly flammable, it emits poisonous fumes that burn the lungs. Once ignited, the cloud of fumes lingers in a 10-ft-radius centered on the burning fungus, and disperses in one minute in a calm wind (or a few seconds in a stiff breeze). Those within the cloud must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw vs. poison or suffer 4 (1d6) poison damage and be poisoned. Each round those that are within the cloud must make the saving throw or suffer the damage.
