A yellow-orange slime mold found growing in dark, humid places, near a supply of constant water. The slime mold is capable of filtering out the salt in salt water and can therefore live in fresh water or by the ocean. When combined with high-grade alcohol and added to a potion, Chromus Slime has the ability to reverse the effects of the potion and create the opposite effects to what the potion or poison would typically do.
