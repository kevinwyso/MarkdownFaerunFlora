This small plant creeps along the ground on long slender stringlike stalks, slowly consuming small bits of detritus and water along its way. It has five or seven-part leaves, and small yellow flowers. The stalks must be boiled in white wine or vinegar and then drunk. The resulting potion will then act as an aphrodisiac, and increases the recipients Charisma by 1 for 1d4 hours.
