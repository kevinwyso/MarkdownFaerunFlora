A small, round cactus with very few large needles. The round body of the cactus holds a large amount of a viscous green liquid. This liquid acts as a stealthy poison, on a failed DC 16 Cons. Save against poison, the goo does 1d4+1 poison damage per round unbeknownst to the poisonâ€™s target, or half as much on a successful save. After 5 rounds, the target begins to feel a burning internal pain centered on the kidneys and liver and damage is calculated.
