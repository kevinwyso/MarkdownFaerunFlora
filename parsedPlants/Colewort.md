Colewort is a small plant with a single large glossy leaf, and small white flowers with four petals commonly found floating on the surface of slow moving water with a long stringy stem anchoring the plant to the bottom of the river or pond. Anyone who chews on the flowers before drinking will remain sober for the entire evening. Its effects protect only against alcohol, and not against any other drug or toxin.
