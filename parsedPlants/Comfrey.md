Comfrey grows to a height of up to 3 feet. It has stiff, angular and hollow stalks which are covered with rough hairs. It has pink, mauve, white, or cream flowers. Its thick black root is the portion used in herbalism and should be boiled and mashed into a poultice which is then wrapped around a broken limb, increasing the speed of healing by fifty percent. It can also be added to a bath by women in order to give the impression that they are virgins on their wedding nights.
