A small flower (roughly 18‚Äù or less) that blooms in the late sping or early summer and resembles a small, pink, sunflower. The coneflower is known for its ability to attract butterflies and honeybees, and if possessed/worn, will cause insect swarms to attack the person who is wearing the flower more frequently.
