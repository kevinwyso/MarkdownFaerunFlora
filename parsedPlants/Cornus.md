Cornus is an alien looking, bulbous fungus that grows into silver balls the size of small melons. These bulbs are full of a silvery, almost metallic liquid that, when injected into the body, will kill any and all hazardous parasites within the body with no negative side-effects aside from slightly more silvery-colored irises for the next week
