The fungus begins life as a tiny spore that floats along until inhaled by a creature, and lodges itself in the moist tissue of the lungs. The spore then begins to grow, causing irritation, pain, and finally death once the fungus has reached a sizable mass. Once the host creature has perished, the fungus increases growth rapidly until it pushes a hollow tendril forth from the flesh. At the exposed end of the tendril the fungus begins growing a thin membrane, which is inflated by the gasses produced by the rotting body. When the membrane ruptures and disperses the spores, every breathing creature within a 40-foot radius sphere must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or inhale spores. If they fail, each hour afterward, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a -1 cumulative penalty to the roll. Each hour the creature suffers a cumulative 1d6 piercing damage (2d6 on the second failure, 3d6 on the third, etc.) as the fungus spreads throughout the internal organs. A single success stops the process and renders the fungus inert. If the fungus catches fire the spore sack soon explodes, and everyone within a 20-foot radius sphere suffers 3d6 fire damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw, DC 15, or half as much on a successful save. All spores are incinerated in this process.
