This hard-to-find four-leafed plant spends most of its life cycle underground, reaching only above the surface to complete the mature stage of its life before dying shortly after. The leaves are a dark blue with small white specks, resembling the night sky, complete with constellations and astral bodies as they would be on the date the plant reaches above the surface. When used in ceremonies by clerics and paladins, the leaves grant a greater success of communicating and reaching a god or goddess, +4 on religion checks or greater success with using spells similar to Commune.
