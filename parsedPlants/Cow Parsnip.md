Cow parsnip has small leaves covered with tiny hairs. These hairs must be shaved from the leaves with a sharp knife and can then be made into a salve. Cow parsnip salve, when applied to the forehead of an afflicted person, will cure madness for a short period (1d4 hours). Repeated application over a two-week period may (DMâ€™s discretion) cure insanity altogether.
