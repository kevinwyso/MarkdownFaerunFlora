A small, shrub-like tree that sprouts pink flowers in spring and summer, turning to small fruits resembling dwarf apples in the late summer and early fall. The fruits of Crab Apple can be pulped and used as a poultice for minor wounds and inflammations, and the bark can be used as a numbing agent if applied with alcohol. In addition, the leaves have some anti-bacterial properties when used in solution. Aside from its common uses, Crab-Apple is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.
