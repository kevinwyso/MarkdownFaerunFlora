biome: Swamps

Growing along the edge of the swamps, their gnarled roots reach down into the brackish water, and their spindly branches reach into the sky. The branches are covered with large amounts of small oval shaped leaves. During warmer seasons the trees bud small hard fruits that drop off to float along the slight currents of a swamp. This species of mangroves has flourished in areas where others have perished, simply for their ability to slowly pull up roots and move to areas with more moisture or better alkalinity. The species is also relatively destructive, as the mangroves also have been known to uproot small trees and brush, or simply walk over them, smashing them down. Wood from these trees burns easily, even when sopping wet.
