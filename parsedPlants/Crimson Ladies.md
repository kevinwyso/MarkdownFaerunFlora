This creeping vine is found on the sides of ruins and growing along the branches of trees. The vine itself is an odd shade of purple, and has wide green leaves. In the summer, the vine sprouts red flowers that resemble a woman wearing a large dress. The flowers that blossom on the vine can be steeped in hot water to make a poisonous tea called Crimson Tears. When Crimson Tears is ingested, the drinker must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d4+2 hours. During this time blood weeps from their eyes, and instead of seeing the world, they see horrific visions of things to come. After recovering from the visions, the character gains Advantage on a single skill roll utilized within the next day, as the visions gave them a brief glimpse of the outcome.
