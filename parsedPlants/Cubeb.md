A climbing, vine plant with broad leaves and spikes of several small, white flowers. Cubeb is commonly believed to be repulsive to demons, especially and virulently to incubi and succubi. Whether the plant actually works for this purpose is unknown, but recipes for incense designed to ward off the demons are commonly exchanged among the superstitious.
