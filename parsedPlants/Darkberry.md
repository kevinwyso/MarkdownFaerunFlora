Short bushes with spindly branches and fluffy green leaves, the plant is known for the unusual berries that only a few of the bushes produce. The small purple berries contain essence from the Plane of Shadow, and the bushes are said to only grow where the Shadow Weave is strongest. When a Darkberry is split or crushed, it releases shadowstuff, creating a circle of magical darkness with a 5ft-radius. This darkness lasts for 1d6 rounds.
