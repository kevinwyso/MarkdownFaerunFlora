biome: Underdark/Caves

Small tapered mushrooms that grow straight upward in large patches, the mushroom is quite rigid thanks to its extra-chitinous shell, and the black exterior makes it difficult to see in the winding caverns of the Underdark. The mushrooms have a slight musky aroma resembling that of dead leaves. Several races seed Blackthorn mushrooms at the bottom of pits, turning them into a lethal surprise for anyone falling down upon them. Add 1d4 piercing damage to any falling damage incurred when a character falls down a hole that has Blackhorn growing at the bottom.
