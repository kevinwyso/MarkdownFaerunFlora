Large black twisted root that grows up to 10 ft; found by waterfalls and similar damp areas. It tastes vile, so chewing/swallowing it induces vomiting. It can be made into Titan Gum, a strong and fast-setting glue that bonds in one round and requires a DC 20 Strength check to remove and works quite painfully on bonding anything with hair.
