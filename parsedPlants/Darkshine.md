biome: Underdark/Caves and Swamps

Crystallizing glossy-black fungus that grows sharp 6-ft long shards. Areas with Darkshine in it function as caltrops that deal 1d10 damage, and damaged creature cannot be magically healed for 1 minute. A patch has 20 hit points and takes half damage from piercing and slashing weapons, but it takes 1 point of damage each hour it is exposed to any light-source stronger than a candle.
