Growing as a singular stalk with pairs of leaves sprouting every few inches, the Darmanzar is covered in small thorns. Touching the plant without gloves causes small cuts which grow swollen and irritated, and remain that way for several hours. The top of the plant sprouts a large bushy bud which is a light gold color. The bud emits a curious sugary fragrance which seems to irritate and deter undead and attract the living. Living characters must make DC 8 Wisdom throw to avoid suffering 1d4 piercing damage and some very itchy swelling. Undead that wish to approach closer than 30 feet from the bud must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw.
