A small flowering shrub found in many plains environments across the realm, the flowers sprout through Spring, Summer, and Fall months, and resemble nuns’ hoods, even maintaining the black and white coloration. Some believe the shrubs were raised using magic in a conservative sect of Clerics or the ultra-religious as the flowering shrub grows up to a foot in every direction instantaneously whenever anyone within a 5’ reach of the shrub curses. This feature makes it a popular houseplant of those trying to refrain from profanity, as pruning the shrub proves to be a monotonous and time-consuming task.
