Growing singularly and rarely on tropical mountaintops, Devarencia is an exceedingly fragile and picky plant in terms of water, humidity, temperature, and sunlight, meaning that many plants do not see maturity. This plant can be mixed into any potion and will prevent different potions from interacting. You can mix up to four potions into one vial. The potions all have their normal effect and no penalties are given.
