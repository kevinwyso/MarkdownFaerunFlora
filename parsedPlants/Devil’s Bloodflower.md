Only a few recorded instances of this red and yellow flower exist. This large and bold red leaf can be going back in history to the dawn of humankind. It was once a popular decoration around homes and gardens, but has become one of the rarest plants in the world. When the petals are consumed, they grant all boons of a Potion of Vitality (removes any exhaustion you are suffering, cures any disease or poison affecting you, and for the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum number of hit points for any hit die you expend). In addition, healing magic and potions heal you for +5 additional hit points for the same period of 24 hours.
