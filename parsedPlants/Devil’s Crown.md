Resembling a cluster of sharp spines that curve upward, the insidious looking plant grows in rocky, inhospitable climates that have very little other life. The roots of such plants dig downward through cracks in stone, and some say that the roots of some of the older plants reach down into Hell itself. Lore about the plant states that it was once native to the infernal planes, but a few hardy seeds were transplanted into some long-forgotten wasteland on Toril, and from there the plant has spread. The plant is quite resilient and tough, with the spines holding moisture in the form of a thick red sap that causes nausea and vomiting if ingested. It is rumored that coating a blade with the sap makes wounds especially painful for celestial creatures (If applied to weapons, +3 damage against celestials. Additionally, any celestials that take this damage must make a DC 13 Cons. Save or be Poisoned for 1d4 minutes).
