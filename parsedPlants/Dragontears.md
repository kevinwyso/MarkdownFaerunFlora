This rare, small, translucent succulent grows primarily in the low desert. When crushed, it exudes a sweet, milky white substance with numbing properties. Properly prepared, dragontears promotes rapid healing and prevents scarring from wounds (heals for 3d8 hit points and prevents scarring upon a successful external application). Drinking dragontears can be fatal, as its numbing properties can cause choking or heart failure when used incorrectly.
