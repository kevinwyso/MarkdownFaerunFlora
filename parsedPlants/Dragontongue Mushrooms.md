The stout stalk of the mushroom is a pale yellow, which transitions to a dark brown at the top before it splits into six black protrusions that appear to be spines, but are soft to the touch. While the mushroom itself isnâ€™t overly poisonous, it can cause hallucinations if brewed into a tea. Members of many cults across the realm delve into the Underdark in order to pick the mushroom, so that they may partake of the hallucinogenic properties. Many of the cultists that hallucinate claim to hear a gravelly dead voice telling them where to find the bones of old dragons or how to summon powerful and evil deities and demons.
