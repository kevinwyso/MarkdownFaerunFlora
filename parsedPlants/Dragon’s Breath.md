A stout stalk nearly bare from leaves except near the base, the plant is covered in fine red hairs that are painful to the touch, as each hair contains a minute amount of poison. The Red Wizards have managed to cultivate small amounts of the plant, but predominantly their supply is harvested from the Hill of Lost Souls. Commonly used as a tea for victims of frostbite and hypothermia. The hairs can be collected individually to ferment and increase the poisonâ€™s effectiveness. Those unfortunate enough to come into contact with the poison must succeed at a Constitution saving throw, DC 13, or suffer 10 (3d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 2d6 minutes. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, they only suffer half damage.
