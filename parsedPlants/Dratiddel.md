Technically a symbiotic relationship between a type of coral and a type of algae, Dratiddel is an incredibly rare organism found on in the bottom of deep-ocean trenches around volcanic spouts. When harvested, the plant is only viable for a period of 12 hours, even if kept in salt water, and completely disintegrates after this time period. Dratiddel can be used to make a powerful potion called Liquid Mortality when shredded and combined with holy oil. Upon a successful application via injury or ingestion, an undead creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw vs poison. On a failed save, their Strength score is permanently reduced by 10. If this effect reduces an undead creature's Strength to 0, they are utterly destroyed, and cannot be resurrected or reanimated by any means other than a wish spell. The creature's Strength score can be restored by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.
