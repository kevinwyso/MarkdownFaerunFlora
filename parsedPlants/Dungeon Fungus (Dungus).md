Dungeon Fungus is a bio-luminescent giant mushroom. The largest specimens stand taller than a man, with caps broad enough for three to lay comfortably upon it. It only ever grows in locations that are frequented by oozes, and have bodies to feed upon. Ingestion of the fungus will cause the recipient to make a DC 14 Cons. Save vs poison or be violently ill for 3d10 rounds (no actions but 1/4 movement speed, -4 penalty to AC). Burning the fungus will produce an intoxicating effect on all those who breathe the fumes. Anyone under the effects of the fungus' smoke will be much more likely to regard others as a friend (+2 to rolls to persuade while under the fumesâ€™ influence), unless they do something particularly harsh. After 1d4 hours the drug will cause anyone under its influence to fall into a deep sleep.
