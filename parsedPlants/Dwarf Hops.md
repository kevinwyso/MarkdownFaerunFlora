Similar to regular hops used in the production of ale, Dwarf Hops are much hardier in terms of cold and grow slightly shorter while producing the same number of hops throughout the Spring, Summer, and Fall. If harvested and preserved correctly, the hops can be worth quite a bit to someone whoâ€™s trained in making Dwarven Ale.
