A strange looking, dark barked tree that seems to grow face-like patterns in its bark. When bark is peeled off or twigs broken, the Edelwood drips a black oil that is as flammable as typical lamp oil and smells of sulfur. According to legend, the Edelwood is a mystical tree that acts as home to the lost souls of those who succumb to the woods, whether through weakness of mind or weakness of body, and the oil from the Edelwood is used as fuel in the black lantern of The Dark Beast.
