A pale white stalk plant that grows under rocky overhangs or deep within caves. The plant has a remarkably short lifecycle, sprouting, growing to maturity, and wilting within only one week following the Winter solstice. When broken open, the plant will ooze a black ichor that when injected directly into the bloodstream brings back characters from unconsciousness, catatonic and even comatose conditions. There is a 1% chance for each day over a week, that the recipient will slip back into their original state and that this plant will not work on them again.
