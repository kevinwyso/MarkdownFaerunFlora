According to old wives’ tales and superstition, elder trees are commonly used as the homes of evil witches and on occasion, even a lich. Building a door from elder supposedly invites bad spirits into your home, and building a crib for the wood will allow for evil spirits to interact with the child. Although much of this superstition has been moved past, it’s still very uncommon to see a door or crib made from this material.
