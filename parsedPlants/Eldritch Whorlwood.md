Tree with a twisted and gnarled grain pattern and shape, and wands made from the wood retain this property. The wood is commonly used for short-term wands and staves, as magical items made from Eldritch Whorlwood are instilled with 4 charges of the spell Darkness. 1d4 charges can be recovered at dawn of every new day. IF all charges are expended, the wand/staff straigtens out and reduces the magical ability of casting with this item.
