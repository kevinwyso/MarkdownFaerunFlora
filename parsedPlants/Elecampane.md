This plant has a thick root, with leaves that are white on the bottom and green on top, as well as showy yellow flowers. The root may be eaten in which case it will cause the recipient to vomit. This effect, while useful in removing ingested poisons from the system, will leave the recipient weak (-1d4 to Constitution for 2d6 hours). For this reason, it may be used as a mildly debilitating poison. If used as a poison, the recipient must succeed on a DC 18 Cons. Save vs. poison.
