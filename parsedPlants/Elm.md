Elm is a wide-spreading tree growing to about 30-feet tall with narrow, rounded leaves and a thick, light brown bark. Long used as a home-remedy for sore throats and aches, stripping the bark and soaking in boiling water, as if making tea, will make an infusion that, when consumed, heals for 1d4 hit points. The herb has no effect when used again until the creature completes a short rest.
