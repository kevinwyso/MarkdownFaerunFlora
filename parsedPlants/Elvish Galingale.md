Elvish Galingale grows to about four feet in height. It has a triangular stem on which grows a tuft of grass like flowers. The roots are boiled and left to stand for a week and the resulting decoction is then drunk. This herb increases the flow of blood. This is very useful when a person is cold. However, if a person is bleeding, either internally or externally, or is wounded with a bleed effect, it will double the speed of bloodloss, effectively doubling bleed damage. Its effect lasts 1d6+1 hours.
