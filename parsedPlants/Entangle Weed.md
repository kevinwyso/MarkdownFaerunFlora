A transparent seaweed that, when submerged in water, becomes almost fully invisible (DC 20 spot check to notice from within 10 ft) native to large bodies of salt water that forms patches of about 400 ft in diameter. Entering a square with it forces a DC 20 Dexterity save against becoming entangled (DC 15 Strength save to escape on a failed Dex. save, +1 to DC per failed attempt as the target gets more entangled). Each failed attempt to escape deal 1d6 nonlethal damage (as referenced on pg. 198 of the PHB). Taking 20 points of this fatiguing damage causes one level of exhaustion. The seaweed instantly wilts when out of water.
