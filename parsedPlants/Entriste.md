A small-leafed ivy that hugs the ground. Entriste's leaves absorb liquid and, when crushed, may be used to draw poison from a wound. (1 leaf absorbs a quarter-pint of liquid. Causes 1d4 damage but draws 100% of poison from a wound if applied within 5 rounds of poisoning, ending the poison effect. Does not work on inhaled poisons.)
