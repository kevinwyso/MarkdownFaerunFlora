This small succulent sedum produces small offshoots which hold between 8 and 16 small leaves. These leaves can then be dried and ground into a powder to mix with a poultice or potion to increase the tier of a healing die by 1, turning a d6 into a d8, etc. This effect can be used during short rests or with healing magic as a poultice, or can be used by adding to a health potion F
