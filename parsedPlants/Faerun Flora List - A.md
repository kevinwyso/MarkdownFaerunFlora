However, many of the trees were felled during the construction of the city’s Great Wall and have never grown back.

Those drinking it say that it tastes fruity, but with a touch of something they can’t quite place. This wine is often called “Angel Wine,” and is sold by Shaarmid merchants throughout Faerun.

After the bark reaches a certain age it begins to crack and peel away from the trunk. If the dark grey bark is boiled in water for three hours, then dried and crushed, it creates a powder that completely neutralizes the flavor and odor of anything blended with the bark as it is crushed, possibly making the plant appropriate for use with poisons or perhaps just bad tasting food. Wood from the Ashvein is exceptionally light weight and releases large amounts of acrid smoke when burned. 

^ashvein

Whether or not any of this is true is debatable, but some will put superstition before what the can see as proof.
