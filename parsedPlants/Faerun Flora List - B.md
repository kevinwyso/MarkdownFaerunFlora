#### Balm

Biome: Plains

Balm is a plant about 2 to 3 feet tall with squarish stems. It has oval, serrated leaves. It has small flowers which can be any shade from white to blue, which form small clusters at the base of the leaves. It reputedly has properties of bestowing longevity and uses as an aphrodisiac, and so could be used as an ingredient in "Potions of Longevity" as well as love potions.

#### Balon’s Plant

Biome: Desert

Growing close to the ground in areas with minimal water, the plant only sprouts a trio of wide, thick leaves which spread outward to absorb as much moisture as possible and provide as much shade to the sandy soil below as possible. Below the sand the root system delves deep to find hidden reservoirs of water that are not evident on the surface. Also known as “bread of the desert”, this plant develops large spherical fruits nearly the size of a man’s head. These fruits have a tough and leathery exterior, but when cut open, the fruit has the consistency of fluffy bread or cake. The seeds of the fruit are quite small. Each fruit contains enough nutrients to sustain four people for a day. Unfortunately, farming the plant seems to be near impossible. The seeds must be within a medium-size creature when it dies, at which point the release of certain gasses causes the seeds to mature and greedily absorb as much moisture and nutrients from the corpse as possible. This rich bounty allows the plant to develop a strong root system.

#### Barberry

Biome: Plains and Forests

The Barberry plant has thin, sharp thorns on its twigs that very easily snap off and become embedded in flesh. It can obtain a height in excess of six feet. It has roughly oval shaped leaves, which are smooth with toothed edges. It has pale yellow flowers which produce ovalur red berries, with a small black dot at their tip. Barberries should be ground up in cold water and be left to stand in cold water, and then boiled quickly. This mixture should be drunk as a cure for liver disorders such as jaundice. If successfully administered the cure should take effect within two weeks. However, three failed applications mean that there is never any hope of cure by this method. 

^barberry

#### Barisc

Biome: Plains, Forests, and Mountains

An extremely prickly bulb plant that, even when ground into a fine paste, retains some of its thorny nature. When this thorny paste is applied to any weapon it will add 4 piercing damage to the next attack.

#### Barrelstalk

Biome: Desert, Underdark/Caves

Large cask-shaped fungus that grows to 5 x 8 ft. Outside is hard as wood, inner flesh is edible, center contains 20 to 50 gallons of water. The fungus is commonly tapped into with a spile or spigot to be used as a source of fresh water and, when emptied, as a food source. After 10 years of growth, it begins spore production and the flesh grows black and poisonous. If the flesh is eaten after this point, the recipient must make a DC 17 Cons. Save vs. poison or take 3d8 poison damage. 

^barrelstalk

#### Base Mullein

Biome: Mountains

Base Mullein is very easily found due to the fact that its flower stalks often obtain a height of 8 feet or more and its leaves are fuzzy and soft. Its small, yellow flowers cover about 3 feet of the top of the stalk in a spike and form a long funnel about an inch or two in diameter. If the leaves of this herb are applied to a burn within one hour, it will heal for half of the damage taken from the burn. 

^base-mullein

#### Betrayer’s Inception

Biome: ???

Smelling slightly of evergreen needles and camphor before its application, this poison is a thin liquid that is prepared via complicated alchemical procedures and unknown plant-based ingredients as the recipe itself was declared illegal and destroyed in most known sources several centuries ago. The poison can be applied to any surface, adhering to it until it comes into contact with organic matter, which it quickly seeps into. It is clear, nearly invisible, and odorless, but can be easily identified by agitating the liquid in any way, which causes it to flash violently with varying hues of light. Due to its use in bringing down many nobles in past generations, it has been banned in nearly every established civilization. Being caught with it on your person is akin to an instant death sentence and one can only learn of its nature by asking the right person. Ask the wrong person, and you may find yourself put to death. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The poisoned creature feels no immediate effect and is unaware of their condition. After a week, the creature gains an effect listed on the short-term madness table (DMG pg. 259). When the short-term effect ends, they gain an effect from the long-term madness table (DMG pg. 260). When the original long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term effect as well as an indefinite effect (DMG pg. 260). After each long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term and indefinite madness effect until they die or are cured. This effect can only be cured by a greater restoration spell cast at 7th level or higher. 

^betrayers-inception

#### Bija Tree

Biome: Arctic and Forests

A leafy evergreen tree, the trunks grow about as round as a man can reach, and their boughs are often fashioned into brooms by common people. The seeds hold another use, and are often ground into a fine powder called Green Sleeping Dust. The dust is primarily used by mercenaries in service to the royal family of Pentillia and as a sleeping drug in higher society. When this powder is inhaled, it forces a target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 2d6 minutes. If the drug is willingly consumed, the target does not have to make this throw and instead just falls unconscious. 

^bija-tree

#### Bilberry

Biome: Forest

Bilberries are small black berries that grow on leafy forest plants resembling blueberry bushes. They must be mixed with pure alcohol and left to stand for fifteen days, at the end of which time they must be drunk. A successful application will give a human the truesight ability for 2d6 days, but a failed application may lead to the death of the person who drinks it, as if they had drunk a potent poison (DC 17 Cons. Save vs poison, or take 6d6 poison damage after 1d4 minutes). 

^bilberry

#### Birthnot

Biome: Arctic and Plains

Birthnot is a dark-leaved, flowerless vine. The dried leaves can be used to create a contraceptive tea effective on most humans, demihumans and humanoids, male or female.

^bishops-weed

#### Bison-Gourd

Biome: Plains and Forests

A vine that grows along the ground, the plant has irregular shaped leaves, and during warmer months the plant produces large yellow flowers shaped like trumpets. The flowers later turn into yellow and orange fruit with a slightly salty taste. The plant’s seeds can also be harvested to extract the oil that works well as an insect repellant. The odor from the oil is almost imperceptible to people, but is effective at repelling bothersome insects. (-2 to Rolls to hit for Insectoids) 

^bison-gourd

#### Bittergar Bush

Biome: Plains

A small thistle-like shrub that grows in most low-lying areas in Faerun, the leaves are the source of an herb called drace. While raw drace is horribly bitter, once cooked it provides a delightful seasoning which enhances the flavor of other food. 

^bittergar-bush

#### Bittermourn

Biome: Arctic

A rare, colorless lichen that grows on rocks beneath year-round ice. When crushed and strained, it creates a clear gel at freezing temperatures that melts into liquid when warmer. Imbibing a pint slows the aging process and grants a lifespan of twice normal length. If imbibed by someone during near-death or immediately after death, will place the person into a deep magical coma and/or reduce the cost of a resurrection spell, up to the DM’s discretion. 

^bittermourn

#### Blackberry

Biome: Plains, Forests, and Mountains

The leaves of these small black berries should be crushed and applied to small wounds, where they can stop minor bleeding very quickly (if applied within one round). 

^blackberry

#### Blackcorn

Biome: Swamps

Resembling actual corn, but in far miniature, the plants generally grow on the edges of swamps and other humid areas. Unlike corn, it is overly difficult to cultivate and farm, which attributes to the rarity of the plant. Upon ripening, small ears of violet and coal colored corn stand upon the tips of the plant stalks. Eating the kernels provides a bitter taste to those willing to try it. However, the vegetable is prized not for eating, but for making a sweet alcohol called Blackcorn Whiskey that has a strong flavor of plums. Due to the heavy alcohol content, it is often mixed with fruit juices. A more potent version of the brew is often distilled by dwarves, but such a process takes considerably longer, and is worth up to 75 gold per bottle. 

^blackcorn

#### Blackroot

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A thin vine that has small dark leaves, the vine predominantly grows underground near lakes and pools. The vine generally grows in places where a small bit of light occurs, sometimes thriving off of the glow provided by phosphorescent moss. Blackroot's roots can be applied to fresh wounds in order to promote quick healing (applied immediately, gives 1d4 back to character at once) while the leaves can be crushed into the powder known as blackroot poison. Those injured by a blade coated in the poison must succeed at a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 16 (4d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour. Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they are Paralyzed for 1d6 minutes. 

^blackroot

#### Black Rose

Biome: Plains, Forests, and Mountains

This rare rose is easily identified by its black, velvety flower and long white thorns. The thorns are hollow and absorb liquids at a rate of a pint every 5 minutes. The liquid is stored in the plant's fibrous roots. The black rose's roots are often used to draw poison from wounds or, placed under the tongue, to absorb alcohol and prevent intoxication. Sometimes victims are tied down and pierced with the thorns to cause prolonged and painful exsanguination. 

^black-rose

#### Blackvein Flower

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A dark red or burgundy flower with black-veined dark-green leaves that commonly grows in small bunches from decaying organic matter, commonly growing from corpses of animals and people. Black Vein Flowers can be turned into the aptly named Black Vein Poison which, after ingestion or injury exposure, will begin to poison the recipient, turning the victim’s blood to a toxic black ichor as it works its way through the system. The target must make a DC 12 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the target will take 2d8 Necrotic damage, and be poisoned for 1d6 hours. During the duration of poisoning, the target will also have a temporary -2 penalty to Constitution. On a successful save, the target will only take half the necrotic damage and not be poisoned. 

^blackvein-flower

#### Bloodbracken

Biome: Forests

A predatory plant that spends 95% of its life underground. The seeds sprout and spread underground, sending out parasitic roots and drawing in nutrients. A few thin tendrils with unremarkable green leaves reach the surface. The seedpod, growing to the size of a large melon over the course of a two-year period, strains and creaks just below the surface. If a creature of sufficient weight steps on the soil above it, it will burst, releasing a cone of red branches that sprays upwards like a land mine, impaling and shredding the target for 10d8 slashing damage. One moment, nothing. The next, a 6' tall red twiggy bush growing through the body of your friend. As the body rots, it provides nutrients for the Bloodbracken to grow and produce seeds. It's entirely safe in this short-lasting mature stage, living to reproduce and wilting after only a few months. If a mature Bloodbracken is found in the wild, the base can be searched to yield bones of unlucky explorers and occasional whatever loot they had on them. 

^bloodbracken

#### Bloodgrass

Biome: Plains, Forests, and Jungles

A wide-bladed grass that grows in small bunches with a red-tinted central vein running the length of the blade. Bloodgrass can be ground into a green and red paste that can be added and mixed into most potions and drinks to become adequate food equivalent to a day’s rations. Cannot be altered by other ingredients. 

^bloodgrass

#### Bloodkeep

Biome: Jungles and Mountains

Tall stalks with jagged leaves and purple-red flowers, bloodkeep's fresh leaves can be bound to a wound to stop bleeding at once and quicken coagulation (apply within 2 rounds of injury to stop bleeding; character regains 20% - rounded down - of lost hit points at once). 

^bloodkeep

#### Bloodpurge

Biome: Swamps

Floating on the surface of marshes, the plant consists of a cluster of broad, waxy leaves, and a single root that trails down into the water. The leaves are a bright green with red capillaries. During the warmer months a bright red flower sprouts from the top. Drying the plant causes it to turn into a flaky powder, which is often used in a distilled tincture to neutralize minor poisons. A single dose of Bloodpurge powder costs about 15 gold pieces, making the plant quite valuable. 

^bloodpurge

#### Bloodroot

Biome: Jungles

A short plant that grows deep in the jungle, the stalks are covered with long pointed leaves. The plant also blossoms red flowers that appear to be similar to roses. Unearthing the plant reveals a massive crimson root that has a faint coppery scent. Many people seek out the plant for the root, which is said to ensure robust fortitude in those that consume it. Upon consuming the bloodroot, a living person must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be Paralyzed for 1 minute. Immediately afterward the creature gains a +2 bonus to their Constitution saving throws for 1d4 hours. Although the initial rush of blood throughout the body causes people to become momentarily stunned, it is often still complimented for the other effects, which some say causes increased virility. What few know is that the root is also sought after by vampires, as it causes increased effects to their undead physiology. Many such creatures take steps to covertly acquire the plant. A vampire consuming the bloodroot immediately gains Advantage on Charisma based skill checks for the next 1d4 hours, and the herb causes them to immediately Rage (as per the Barbarian class feature) if they smell blood. 

^bloodroot

#### Bloodspine

Biome: Desert, Mountains

A succulent plant growing in rocky soil, a cluster of thick leaves reach upward toward the sky, their edges covered in sharp thorns and the tips bearing a single crimson spine. Interestingly, the plant secretes a slight poison from these spines which may cause paralysis in small animals or the infirm. Those with hardier constitutions seek out the poison, as it provides a slight euphoric effect in addition to the paralysis. The poison requires only a DC 5 Constitution save, or the injured will suffer complete paralysis for 1d4 hours. Those that succeed at the saving throw notice a slight euphoric effect for the same amount of time. 

^bloodspine

#### Bloodstaunch

Biome: Desert, Mountains

A small, leafy herb that is often found in gullies and ravines in arid regions and foothills. The herb has bright green leaves, and smells faintly like honey crossed with fresh rainfall. Grinding up the plant creates a powder that can be used on open wounds to quickly cause bleeding to slow or stop. Applying the herb to a bleeding wound grants the recipient recovery of 1 hit point and makes the recipient immune to bleed damage for 1d4 hours. 

^bloodstaunch

#### Bluecap

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Common underdark crop mushroom, dark blue with pale grey spots and a pale grey stalk. The fugus itself is inedible, but spores can be made into flour. Grows with or without natural light. 

^bluecap

#### Blueleaf

Biome: Arctic and Forests

Known for the gleaming blue color of the leaves, the tree often grows in thick copses throughout the north. The thin trunks of the trees are remarkably durable, despite high winds and heavy snowfall, and one use of the tree is the wood, which is often used by the Volodni craftsmen to create weapons and armor. Magically treating the wood, which is called “bluewood”, causes it to become as hard as steel, although only weighing half as much (crafting with bluewood requires special training from a masterwork craftsperson). High priced entertainers often burn small pieces of the wood, which creates leaping blue flames. The leaves and sap are often ground in the creation of a vivid blue dye that is used to dye clothes in the North, and often in the creation of inks for tattoos. One pirate fleet that has plagued the Sword Coast in recent years is notorious for their crews bearing frightening looking blue tattoos covering their faces. 

^blueleaf

#### Bocraugh

Biome: Jungles and Mountains

Bocraugh is a colossal truffle-like fungus that can be distilled down to a sticky black paste (one large truffle to produce 1 fl. Oz. of paste) causing any type of seed to grow to full maturity within 1d4 minutes. This applies to trees, herbs, plant creatures, and even plants that take hundreds of years to bloom.

#### Bodhi Tree (Sacred Fig)

Biome: Jungles and Cities

According to legend, the bodhi tree was once the spiritual home of a persistent monk seeking enlightenment. The monk sat under this tree and meditated for close to seven years, surviving only on the tree’s collected water droplets and on the tree’s bounty of figs. After learning of this monk’s quest for enlightenment, a corrupt king wanted in on this understanding of everything and wanted it only for himself, and ordered the tree destroyed. The roots were hacked at with swords and glaives and major limbs felled with large axes. All the while, the monk sat beneath the tree and still meditated. When the king’s servants had finished their destruction, the monk retrieved a bottle of sacramental wine from his bag and fed it to the tree’s damaged roots, vowing that if the tree should die, so would he. Upon the completion of this vow, the tree’s roots absorbed the wine and began to repair themselves at an incredibly rate, and the tree grew larger and lusher than it had been before. The location of the original tree has been lost to the ages, but cuttings of the tree have been transplanted to many of the major monasteries of the realm as a symbol of divine power and belief. 

^bodhi-tree-sacred-fig

#### Bone Fungus

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Bulbous ivory-colored fungus that releases a 10 ft cloud of spores, in the presence of motion, that work as an inhaled poison (DC Constitution 15, 1d8-1 poison damage). If damage is taken, bone density is reduced, resulting in extra damage from bludgeoning in the form of an extra space for criticals against you (19 or 20 counts as a crit). The fungi are immune to acid and thunder, destroyed by cold or radiant damage, fire and electricity also destroy but release spores. Recovery from the reduced bone density is only capable in the consumption of magically created potions and through Lesser Restoration spells. 

^bone-fungus

#### Boomshroom

Biome: Swamps

Typically found in swamps and marshes growing in patches with a radius of up to 300 ft. A successful Sleight of Hand check allows you to pick one, but it renders them inert.

^borage

#### Borneas

Biome: Plains, Forests, Jungles

A leafy, ground-cover plant found in forests all over the realm. Slightly resembles sage or salvia. When lit, the smoke will aid in sustaining meditation and trances for religious ceremonies, granting a +3 to religion checks made by Clerics or Paladins for 1d8 minutes after inhalation of the smoke. 

^borneas

#### Brandac

Biome: Mountains

A bright orange mushroom that grows only on mountains that were once or still are volcanically active. The mushroom can be dried and crushed into a highly volatile dust. The dust will ignite if it comes into contact with any other substance then glass, crystal or ceramic materials. It will ignite any flammable materials in a 2- meter radius and does 3d6 points of damage at the center and 2d6 damage in the rest. Small amounts can be used to start campfires and light torches

#### Brawler’s Blackcorn

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Resembling Blackcorn in miniature, Brawler’s Blackcorn is a hardy plant that grows without light in dark cave environs. The kernels of this corn can be dried and ground and mixed into hard liquors, typically a bourbon (Brawler’s Bourbon). Brawler’s Bourbon is typically used by cheating gamblers to give themselves an unfair advantage. Ingesting the bourbon makes the user immune to its secondary properties, and so cheating brawlers may take a swig of the bourbon and spill some on their hands. The poison works as a contact toxin that will then weaken the opponent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The target must make a DC 14 Cons. Save vs poison or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature is then also knocked unconscious for the same amount of time. The target can be woken if they take damage or are shaken awake by another person. On a successful save, the target is then immune to the poison’s effects for 12 hours.
