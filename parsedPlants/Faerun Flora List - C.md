#### Caffar

Biome: Jungles

A small, brown nut that grows from short, green, leafy understory plants in tropical forests, typically ground into powder and brewed into a dark, sweet-smelling beverage, traditionally with a goat's milk base. The drink is renowned by shaman and psionics for its boon to their all-seeing abilities. (+1 to all wisdom checks until the next long rest. If more than three cups are imbibed, causes a -2 to rolls to hit as the imbiber is too jumpy and caffeinated to focus.)

#### Cachuga Pepper

Biome: Plains

Cachuga Peppers can only be found on growing in or around plains that are home to hot springs or geysers. Cachuga peppers are vaguely pyramidal shaped woody bushes with profuse foliage that bear clusters of small, fragrant yellow blooms which eventually give way to fiery peppers of a marbled red-orange. The bushes bloom continually in the tropical climes of the Swordfish Islands causing Cachuga bushes to produce large numbers of these firey peppers. The peppers themselves are 2-4 inches long and hang from the bushes by thick, green, vein-like structures. Cachuga Peppers are exceptionally spicy and flavorful, and the skin of these peppers is leathery and can be mashed into a paste, then shaped and dried into chips or a flavorful yet non-spicy paper-like wrapping, pairing nicely with raw fish. The peppers dry well, retaining their fire and flavor for exceptional periods of time, and their seeds can be ground into a powder that causes *severe* eye and skin irritation (DC 16 Cons. Save or blindness for 3d10 minutes).

#### Calacaza Bush

Biome: Jungles and Deserts

A fragrant bush that grows in the dense jungle and sparse desert, the veined leaves and branches are a pale green, and the plant appears to strive to reach upward toward the canopy above. At the end of each branch are clusters of small white flowers or berries, depending on the time of year. The small white berries that the plant produces are actually quite poisonous (Those that ingest the berries must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw vs poison or suffer 32 (8d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1d6 hours. If the target succeeds the saving throw, they only suffer half damage with no poisoning). Local tribes avoid the berries unless they are using them to coat their arrowheads and blowgun darts (Adds +2 poison damage to successful attacks made using a blowgun). 

^calacaza-bush

#### Calamus

Biome: Jungles, Coastal, and Rivers

This reed grows in small grassy clumps. It can grow from about 2 to 6 feet in height and has very small yellow green flowers that jut out from the stem. The leaves are long, thin and light green in color and smell faintly sweet. The root is white with a red brown peel. The root must be peeled and boiled in fresh water within a day of being picked, and should then be drunk by the recipient. Provided no permanent physical damage has been done to the person’s hearing organs, the herb may restore some small measure of hearing to a totally deaf person, perhaps 10% of normal hearing, and granting +1 to perception checks involving sound in people who have full use of their ears. In addition, the herb has been reported to have aphrodisiac qualities (DM’s discretion) and was used by certain tribes of ancient peoples to make their dogs more fierce (DM’s discretion). 

^calamus

#### Calcena Mushroom

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Anyone who breathes in the spores of one of these small, pink mushrooms incurs a -3 penalty on all Wisdom saves vs illusions for 2d12 hours. The mushroom may be brewed into a potion by brewing tea and leaving the mushroom to stand in the tea for 2 weeks. The resultant concoction when drunk is a powerful hallucinogen. Anyone under the influence of it will see whatever the DM wants them to see. This effect lasts for 1d4 hours in which the player enters a trance and responds lazily to interaction with other characters or NPC’s. 

^calcena-mushroom

#### Calithil

Biome: Mountains

A twisted and tough vine that grows in rocky crags high in the mountains, the waxy leaves of the plant are small and grow in clumps. Small white flowers grow on the vines, which turn into light blue berries which are quite tart. Dwarves send their children out to pick the berries, so that they may be harvested into a specialty wine and jams. Those drinking the wine often have an unfounded and untrue feeling of invincibility, while those consuming the jam often feel satiated and satisfied with their meal. 

^calithil

#### Callin

Biome: Jungles

A dark nut that grows on the Callin tree in tropical jungles. When the husk is dried, ground and ingested, it thins the blood and strengthens internal organs, helping to prevent heart attacks, and has the side effect of reducing anxiety and panic. 

^callin

#### Callofex

Biome: Forests and Plains

A somewhat stubborn vine plant that grows in open fields and along forest paths with a knack for regrowth. Every attempt to hack at the plant with any form of bladed instrument causes an increase in the vine’s length and girth. Traditionally the plant grows very slowly, only gaining an inch or so in length and thickness annually, but with enough hacking and slashing, the vine can prove to be an incredible pest to farmers and travllers. 

^callofex

#### Caravara

Biome: Deserts

A button sized, arid-environment fungi that produces spores that resemble black sand. If inhaled or ingested purposefully in large doses, these spores will allow the recipient to take an additional action in the place of a bonus action once per combat for 1d8 hours. 

^caravara

#### Cassil

Biome: Plains, Forests, Jungles

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Glowing yellow lichen found on chill cave roofs that can't stand warm places. When combined with phosphorus powder and a strong acid, Cave Star can be made into Lantern Stars, which are fist-sized balls of glass or vials that give light as a torch for 8 hours at a time. 

^cave-star

#### Cephalophage

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A pale, fleshy fungus with a tough, rubbery consistency that is commonly found growing near carnivorous plants. The fungus grows upon corpses, absorbing the cadaver's life memories and personality; up to 10 different minds have been found absorbed by one cephalophage mushroom. Eating cephalophage will transfer those memories and personality quirks to the eater. (Effects last 1d4 hours and while they last the eater can access all of the dead person's mind. After the effects wear off, the eater may still succumb on occasion to "flashbacks" or personality instability; when under intense stress or in a situation liable to cause such flashbacks, the user must make a roll of under their intelligence modifier or be overcome with memories of another person’s life.) This plant is condemned by some religions as unholy, believed to prevent a soul/spirit from attaining the afterlife and possibly in creating undead. 

^cephalophage

#### Ceran

Biome: Arctic

A short, hardy, tea-like shrub that grows in the cold climates of the Dalelands and Northern mountains. Drinking this herbal brew will result in a warm tingling feeling inside; all the effects of being in extreme cold conditions will be negated for 2d4 hours. 

^ceran

#### Chamomile

Biome: Plains

This plant can grow up to 2 feet tall, and has a branched stem. It has few leaves, and these are finely divided. The flower heads have yellow centres which are domed in shape with a hollow cavity at their very center. The petals of this plant bend backwards towards the stem. The flowers from a single plant must be immersed in boiling water and the resultant drink consumed. This drink is very bitter and is normally mixed with honey, but this is not fully necessary. The drink will last for approximately 2 months after manufacture, while the leaves can be dried, and will then keep for up to three years. A successful use of this herb will have a calming effect on the consumer, commonly used as a minor sleep aid. 

^chamomile

#### Chervil

Biome: Forests and Jungles

Chervil, a ground-cover plant similar to parsley, can be turned into a tincture that is used to dissolve blood clots, which can help to prevent complications caused by injury. The clots are dissolved within 1d4 turns. Since they dissolve clots, improper use of this herb leads to +1 bleeding damage for the next 1d8 hours in every successful attack against the consumer. 

^chervil

#### Choke Mold

Biome: Underdark/Caves and Swamps

Bright yellow mold native to caves and swamps, commonly found in patches that devour air, creating localized vacuums (can cause air-tight space to collapse inwards). Creatures within 5 ft of a patch begin to suffocate as breatheable air is pulled away from them, and within 10 feet of these patches, flames begin to sputter and go out. 

^choke-mold

#### Choking Cinder Fungus

Biome: Jungles and Swamps

Growing on rotting wood in moist climates, this black fungus is generally avoided by those gathering firewood. While the fungus is highly flammable, it emits poisonous fumes that burn the lungs. Once ignited, the cloud of fumes lingers in a 10-ft-radius centered on the burning fungus, and disperses in one minute in a calm wind (or a few seconds in a stiff breeze). Those within the cloud must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw vs. poison or suffer 4 (1d6) poison damage and be poisoned. Each round those that are within the cloud must make the saving throw or suffer the damage. 

^choking-cinder-fungus

#### Chromus Slime

Biome: Coastal, Swamps, Underdark/Caves

A yellow-orange slime mold found growing in dark, humid places, near a supply of constant water. The slime mold is capable of filtering out the salt in salt water and can therefore live in fresh water or by the ocean. When combined with high-grade alcohol and added to a potion, Chromus Slime has the ability to reverse the effects of the potion and create the opposite effects to what the potion or poison would typically do. 

^chromus-slime

#### Cinquefort

Biome: Forests

This small plant creeps along the ground on long slender stringlike stalks, slowly consuming small bits of detritus and water along its way. It has five or seven-part leaves, and small yellow flowers. The stalks must be boiled in white wine or vinegar and then drunk. The resulting potion will then act as an aphrodisiac, and increases the recipients Charisma by 1 for 1d4 hours. 

^cinquefort

#### Cline Cactus

Biome: Desert

A small, round cactus with very few large needles. The round body of the cactus holds a large amount of a viscous green liquid. This liquid acts as a stealthy poison, on a failed DC 16 Cons. Save against poison, the goo does 1d4+1 poison damage per round unbeknownst to the poison’s target, or half as much on a successful save. After 5 rounds, the target begins to feel a burning internal pain centered on the kidneys and liver and damage is calculated. 

^cline-cactus

#### Coldwood

Biome: Arctic and Forests

A Fey-created variety of Hickory that reaches maturity in 2 decades and has properties identical to steel, except Fey and Druids can easily work with the wood without it affecting their magic. Items made from Coldwood require masterwork, making the raw material quite valuable. 

^coldwood

#### Colewort

Biome: Rivers

Colewort is a small plant with a single large glossy leaf, and small white flowers with four petals commonly found floating on the surface of slow moving water with a long stringy stem anchoring the plant to the bottom of the river or pond. Anyone who chews on the flowers before drinking will remain sober for the entire evening. Its effects protect only against alcohol, and not against any other drug or toxin. 

^colewort

#### Coltsfoot

Biome: Plains

The plant has a single golden yellow flower borne at the top of a six-inch-tall stem with long, pinkish woolly scales. These flowers are crushed and mixed with honey, and applied as a poultice to infected wounds in an effort to draw out the infection. It does not cure any damage. 

^coltsfoot

#### Comfrey

Biome: Plains

Comfrey grows to a height of up to 3 feet. It has stiff, angular and hollow stalks which are covered with rough hairs. It has pink, mauve, white, or cream flowers. Its thick black root is the portion used in herbalism and should be boiled and mashed into a poultice which is then wrapped around a broken limb, increasing the speed of healing by fifty percent. It can also be added to a bath by women in order to give the impression that they are virgins on their wedding nights. 

^comfrey

#### Common Coneflower

Biome: Plains

A small flower (roughly 18” or less) that blooms in the late sping or early summer and resembles a small, pink, sunflower. The coneflower is known for its ability to attract butterflies and honeybees, and if possessed/worn, will cause insect swarms to attack the person who is wearing the flower more frequently. 

^common-coneflower

#### Constrictor Vine

Biome: Plains and Forests

Instead of growing upward to seek light, the Constrictor Vine spreads out across the ground as a thick mat of small, glossy leaves. The plant blooms occasionally with unremarkable clusters of small green flowers that give way to oblong yellow berries favored by birds and small animals. While the leaf mat of the Constrictor Vine rarely reaches more than 10' in diameter its root system can stretch as far as 50'. The fibrous roots of a Constrictor Vine resemble wet human hair, are incredibly strong, and retain much of this strength even after being harvested and dried. As the roots grow, they wrap themselves around rocks, root systems, and anything else in their path. When the roots reach ~30' to ~50' they begin to slowly, yet inexorably constrict back towards the core of the plant. This constriction has been known to topple whole trees and move many ton boulders. Since the process is so slow, it poses no real danger to living creatures. 

^constrictor-vine

#### Cornus

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Cornus is an alien looking, bulbous fungus that grows into silver balls the size of small melons. These bulbs are full of a silvery, almost metallic liquid that, when injected into the body, will kill any and all hazardous parasites within the body with no negative side-effects aside from slightly more silvery-colored irises for the next week 

^cornus

#### Corpsebomb

Biome: Underdark/Caves and Swamps

The fungus begins life as a tiny spore that floats along until inhaled by a creature, and lodges itself in the moist tissue of the lungs. The spore then begins to grow, causing irritation, pain, and finally death once the fungus has reached a sizable mass. Once the host creature has perished, the fungus increases growth rapidly until it pushes a hollow tendril forth from the flesh. At the exposed end of the tendril the fungus begins growing a thin membrane, which is inflated by the gasses produced by the rotting body. When the membrane ruptures and disperses the spores, every breathing creature within a 40-foot radius sphere must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or inhale spores. If they fail, each hour afterward, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a -1 cumulative penalty to the roll. Each hour the creature suffers a cumulative 1d6 piercing damage (2d6 on the second failure, 3d6 on the third, etc.) as the fungus spreads throughout the internal organs. A single success stops the process and renders the fungus inert. If the fungus catches fire the spore sack soon explodes, and everyone within a 20-foot radius sphere suffers 3d6 fire damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw, DC 15, or half as much on a successful save. All spores are incinerated in this process. 

^corpsebomb

#### Cosmos Glond

Biome: Jungles and Underdark/Caves

This hard-to-find four-leafed plant spends most of its life cycle underground, reaching only above the surface to complete the mature stage of its life before dying shortly after. The leaves are a dark blue with small white specks, resembling the night sky, complete with constellations and astral bodies as they would be on the date the plant reaches above the surface. When used in ceremonies by clerics and paladins, the leaves grant a greater success of communicating and reaching a god or goddess, +4 on religion checks or greater success with using spells similar to Commune. 

^cosmos-glond

#### Cotsbalm

Biome: Forests and Jungles

Fleshy-leafed plant with small yellow flowers that grows 1 ft tall. It is hardy and found in temperate and sub-tropical regions. Its syrupy sap can be applied to an poisoning victim to grant a +8 bonus on the secondary Constitution save against a poison if the poison allows for one. 

^cotsbalm

#### Covadish

Biome: Arctic

Plant originally native to Aerenal, and later transplanted to the cold, harsh arctic climate, whose leaves, when consumed by spellcasters, grant boons to any spells cast in the school of necromancy (these boons up to DM’s discretion) until the next short rest. 

^covadish

#### Cow Parsnip

Biome: Plains

Cow parsnip has small leaves covered with tiny hairs. These hairs must be shaved from the leaves with a sharp knife and can then be made into a salve. Cow parsnip salve, when applied to the forehead of an afflicted person, will cure madness for a short period (1d4 hours). Repeated application over a two-week period may (DM’s discretion) cure insanity altogether. 

^cow-parsnip

#### Cow-Wheat

Biome: Plains and Forests

Cow wheat is a small straight stemmed yellow-green plant. Its pale-yellow flowers produce a white powder when crushed, between two hands. If this powder is placed into food or drink it will cause a person to act as if very drunk. Each dose of this herb successfully administered will increase the level of drunkenness by one step. 

Drunkeness: - Step 1: -1 to Intelligence until sober - Step 2: -1 to Wisdom until sober - Step 3: -1 to Charisma until sober - Step 4: -1 to Dexterity until sober - Step 5: the player now has disadvantage on all skill checks and attacks - Step 6: the player now has disadvantage on all saves. - Step 7: the player blacks out for 1d4 hours. 

^cow-wheat

#### Crab-Apple

Biome: Forests and Cities

A small, shrub-like tree that sprouts pink flowers in spring and summer, turning to small fruits resembling dwarf apples in the late summer and early fall. The fruits of Crab Apple can be pulped and used as a poultice for minor wounds and inflammations, and the bark can be used as a numbing agent if applied with alcohol. In addition, the leaves have some anti-bacterial properties when used in solution. Aside from its common uses, Crab-Apple is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease. 

^crab-apple

#### Creeping Mangrove

Biome: Swamps

Growing along the edge of the swamps, their gnarled roots reach down into the brackish water, and their spindly branches reach into the sky. The branches are covered with large amounts of small oval shaped leaves. During warmer seasons the trees bud small hard fruits that drop off to float along the slight currents of a swamp. This species of mangroves has flourished in areas where others have perished, simply for their ability to slowly pull up roots and move to areas with more moisture or better alkalinity. The species is also relatively destructive, as the mangroves also have been known to uproot small trees and brush, or simply walk over them, smashing them down. Wood from these trees burns easily, even when sopping wet. 

^creeping-mangrove

#### Crimson Ladies

Biome: Forests and Jungles

This creeping vine is found on the sides of ruins and growing along the branches of trees. The vine itself is an odd shade of purple, and has wide green leaves. In the summer, the vine sprouts red flowers that resemble a woman wearing a large dress. The flowers that blossom on the vine can be steeped in hot water to make a poisonous tea called Crimson Tears. When Crimson Tears is ingested, the drinker must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d4+2 hours. During this time blood weeps from their eyes, and instead of seeing the world, they see horrific visions of things to come. After recovering from the visions, the character gains Advantage on a single skill roll utilized within the next day, as the visions gave them a brief glimpse of the outcome. 

^crimson-ladies

#### Crisp Chondrus

Biome: Coastal

A hardy, red algae that commonly washes up on sandy coasts and stays fresh for several hours. After consuming the algae, the creature regains 2d4 hit points and must make a DC 12 Cons.
