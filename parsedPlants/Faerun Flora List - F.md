#### Fairy Bells

Biome: Plains

A leafy green plant that springs up in clusters, the majority of the plant is rather uninteresting, save for the violet flowers that seem to bloom almost year-round. When the wind blows through the flowers, their seeds rattle around inside and create a curious ringing sound, much like tiny bells. Many rural children enjoy picking them and weaving the flowers into their garments, which then jingle as they run and twirl. There is also a legend that the sound of the flowers ward off evil spirits, a legend that is partially true. Any fiend must make a DC 15 Wisdom save vs. fear in order to approach within 10 feet of the fairy bells or anyone wearing them.

#### False Unicorn Root

Biome: Plains

A woody-stemmed flower with a large, white, cone-shaped flower that blooms from the top of the stalk. Very rare due to its slow growth and limited growing conditions, False Unicorn Horn has a rich history rooted in folklore. Supposedly, the root used to possess not only extremely beneficial healing properties, but extraordinary magic. This so angered some greater demons, that they sent an army of lesser demons to uproot and eat as many of the roots as they could, and this rage was so powerful that to this day the roots have not been able to fully grow back. The remaining tuberous stub is still imbued with good medicine and every spring it is able to put forth the tall spike of magic-imbued white flowers as a reminder that the power of good can always avert the forces of evil. (Consumption of this root will heal the recipient for 2d6+2 hit points, and make the individual invisible to demons and infernals for 1d4 hours.)

#### Fennel

Biome: Plains

Fennel has thick stems, and bright green, lacy leaves and routinely grows to about five feet in height. (There is a rare form which has a bronze stem. In terms of its use, it is identical to the common fennel). In summer it has golden, yellow flowers. These flowers turn to seed in early Autumn. The seed heads must be harvested and left until the seeds separate from them. The seeds may then be mixed with boiling water to make a tea. This tea has the effect of relieving hunger in the recipient for 2d8 hours, However, it does not in any way act as a substitute for food, and any damage or exhaustion due to starvation will still occur. Any negative effects of exhaustion already being felt will evaporate for 1d8 hours. Aside from its common uses, Fennel is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.

#### Fire Flower

Biome: Jungles and Mountains

It is suggested that this herb be found in one location on an entire world, ideally in a Mountain range in a tropical or subtropical region. Fire Flower is a small bush which has one pale golden flower and small red berries with the appearance of a live coal. The flowers of the bush must be taken and crushed into a diamond or adamantine vial and left to cure for ten years. This is also the amount of time needed for a single flower to bloom. A single drop of this elixir will heal any illness or injury, but will not allow limbs or other appendages to grow back, and is said to return the dead to some state of undeath. This is an incredibly powerful herb, and is likely to only exist in the hands of powerful lords and kings.

#### Firethorn

Biome: Coastal

Often called the Sea Rose, this flower exists almost entirely on the Island of the Firethorns in the northern Sorlorn Sea. The flower grows in such numbers that it gives the lower areas of the island a reddish hue. At night the island faintly glows from a distance due to the natural glowing property of the flowers, and many that transverse the Great Sea know of the island’s distant glow. The island is generally uninhabited, with the exception of the fishing village of Safe Cove and the city of Hawa, because the Firethorns are so poisonous (DC 15 Cons. Save vs. poisoned while standing within 45 feet of the flowers and their pollen; on a failed save take 4d8 poison damage and be poisoned for 1d6 hours, on a successful save take half as much damage without being poisoned). Inhabitants of both settlements are well aware of the toxicity of the flowers, and often give them a wide berth. 

^firethorn

#### Fjor’da

Biome: Rivers and Swamps

After three days the amnesia becomes permanent and there is no hope of recovery, and this day will be forever lost in the person’s mind. Some sinister organizations have started propagating Fjor’da in order to harvest this pollen for use in an inhaled poison called Silt Fjor’da (DC 18 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the recipient automatically forgets the last 24 hours with no possibility of recovery. On a successful save, the recipient has a 50% chance to recover the memories of the day).

^flame-clove

#### Flame Petal

Biome: Plains

This large flower blooms in the height of summer, unfurling large red petals, and yellow-tipped orange tendrils which sway in the faintest of winds to give the illusion that the flower is on fire. As they often grow in large clumps, at first glance one might even believe that the ground was on fire. Such flowers are sought as decoration during the Summer Solstice and Midsummer celebrations in the Dalelands. Young women will wear them in their hair (+3 to Nature Checks while wearing the flower in this manner), and they are said to bring a bountiful crop to any person that would plant them near their front doors.

^fleshwort

#### Flintmoss

Biome: Rivers and Mountains

A dark grey moss, dotted with small flecks of rust-brown, Flint Moss is commonly found in area of thermal activity or bright and constant sunlight. The moss requires fire to spread its seeds, and will ignite from even the smallest sparks. A 3" cube of Flint Moss will burn for 3 to 4 hours and put off flame comparable to a normal sized camp fire. The moss growing on piles of rubble or loose rock is the most dangerous as friction from shifting stones can create enough heat or sparks to ignite patches of the moss, turning what was once a moss-covered mound of debris into a raging inferno. Application of Flintmoss to a bludgeoning weapon and lighting the weapon ablaze will add +3 fire damage to any successful attacks made with the weapon for 1d4+1 hours after application.

#### Footleaf

Biome: Arctic and Mountains

This 30-cm high plant has 3 thick, fleshy leaves, dark green and covered with soft hairs. The light green blades that account for its height are actually bunches sheathes from which flower stalks grow during the summer covered in a waxy, protective coating. From each of the sheathes (there can be as many as 30 to a plant), a single flower stalk grows with tiny purple flowers. The thick leaves, which can become as large as 20 cm across, can be torn loose and put inside your boots (one leaf to a boot), enabling you to walk all day without tiring or even getting footsore (negating the need for a Forced March), as well as adding 5 to your movement speed until the next long rest, at which point, the flower must be replaced.

#### Furyax

Biome: Jungles and Mountains
