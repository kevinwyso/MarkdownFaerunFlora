#### Garadar

Biome: Plains

A 5 to 8-foot shrub with waxy, hard leaves resembling those of a succulent. When this leaf is soaked in water, it will release a very pungent scent that will attract male ogres in a one-mile radius. The scent resembles that of a female ogre. The smell lingers for 1d4 hours.

#### Gardenflax

Biome: Cities, Forests, Jungles, Plains

The brown seeds of this herb (which has deep blue flowers), if chewed, remove all pain from a character’s wounds. It will also prevent a character from feeling any physical pain for 1d8 hours. The recipient could walk through a fire and feel no pain. There is a 50% chance per hour that a character moving normally will suffer 1d6 damage, while under the influence of this herb. This occurs because the character does not notice minor bruises or scratches. It was widely believed in medieval times that if the seeds of this plant were strewn across a vampire’s path the vampire would be unable to proceed further, until it had picked up and counted every seed. At the DM’s discretion this may be a use for this herb in campaigns.

#### Gariig

#### Gefnul

Biome: Arctic and Mountains

Gefnul will totally cure and heal the recipient if eaten within one week of harvesting. However, a 1d100 penalty roll must be made. A roll of over the recipient’ hit points will automatically KO, putting the recipient into a death save scenario, and a roll of 100 will kill the recipient outright.

#### Ginyak Weed

Biome: Plains and Cities

An invasive plague on many farmers is the weed that has been known to choke out large sections of crops if left unchecked. Many farmers curse the weed, as it has been one of the many factors that caused famine in recent years. Unfortunately, when burning Ginyak, the resulting smoke produces an acrid stench which lingers in the air for weeks afterward. Livestock dislike the smell and attempt to avoid it whenever possible (If burned, anyone in the presence of the smoke takes a -3 penalty to animal handling checks for 1 week).

^goblin-rogue

#### Goblin-Trap

Biome: Swamps

Often found in clusters, these plants resemble brown leathery vases sitting on the ground with ragged leaves splayed out around the base where thick roots grasp the earth. The tops are open, and if one should peer inside the glint of their golden seeds can be seen in the interior. However, these plants are traps, and many explorer has come across the remains of smaller humanoids, their hands still clutching the golden seed pods. If someone is unwise enough to stick their hand within the pod, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or suffer 1d4 damage from the internal spines of the plant, and are then grappled. Their leathery surface has an Armor Class of 11, and to free a trapped arm 10 points of damage must be inflicted upon the plant. Ripping the plant out of the ground requires a Strength check, DC 20, and inflicts another 1d4 damage upon the trapped victim. 

^goblin-trap

#### Goblinberry Bush

Biome: Mountains

Growing in high, desolate areas, the small bushes have dark green leaves that are nearly black, with silver undersides. The bushes sporadically sprout reddish-purple berries that have a strong sharp smell that often causes people to gag. Mixing the juice of the berries with a significant quantity of water and honey makes an interesting drink that is served sporadically in Evereska and Baldur’s Gate. The juice can also be used as an astringent, if the patient can handle the smell. 

^goblinberry-bush

#### Golden Coin Cactus

Biome: Desert and Mountains

This hardy plant is a large yellow disk standing on end, slightly bulging in the center, and covered with small red spines. Several ragged leaves grow from the base of the plant, and the root system of the cactus reaches deep beneath the rocky soil. The red spines contain a mild toxin which kills smaller vermin, but provides a mild anesthetic to small creatures or larger. The nomads of the Shaarmid steep the spines in hot water to make a tea to sooth sore throats and pacify infants. 

^golden-coin-cactus

#### Golden Crown

#### Golden Lungwort

Biome: Forests and Jungles

Golden lungwort has large oval leaves, covered with small hairs, and small pale blotches. It grows to a height of about 1 foot, and has small bell-shaped flowers with five petals which change color from pink to mauve to blue. Flowers of different colors are often found on the same plant.

^goldencup

#### Goldenweb

Biome: Forests

A quick growing fungus that is often found spread between tree branches, it appears as a strange lattice similar to spiderwebs. Light shining through the strands causes them to subtly glow the color of gold, and the fungus has also been called “Goblin’s Greed”. While the strands of the fungus are slightly stronger than spiderwebs, they lack the stickiness that would cause them to impede or entangle creatures. The fungus works surprisingly well as an anticoagulant, and is quite absorbent. Healers often seek the fungus out when attempting to remedy injury poisons, and use of the fungus grants a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Medicine) skill checks when used in such a manner. 

^goldenweb

#### Gotu Kola (Tiger’s Calm)

Biome: Jungles

A parsley like herb that grows low to the ground in warm, jungle environments. The herb gets its name because injured big cats have often been observed rolling around in Gotu Kola to heal their wounds from inter-species fights or from hunters. (The herb can be used to heal beasts, and only beasts for 1d8+3 hit points.) 

^gotu-kola-tigers-calm

#### Grammax Creeper

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A flesh colored slime mold, the Grammax Creeper slowly spreads through the Underdark, digesting any organic material in its path. The mold moves slowly enough that even people sleeping in its path have no fear of being overwhelmed, although corpses that lay in the same place for days will be overcome. The Grammax also floats on water, often spreading across the surface of underground puddles and stagnant lakes, hiding the actual depths. The Grammax reacts rapidly to the presence of flame or high heat, quickly shrinking away while expelling any trapped gas. This action of the escaping gas makes an odd shrieking sound that is akin to the sound a screaming child makes. While it is a barely palatable prospect, the mold can actually be consumed as a source of food for those lost and desperate enough (at the cost of a level of exhaustion when consumed by any race except for goblinoids). Oddly, goblins seem to enjoy the taste of the mold, and often scrape it up as a renewable food source. 

^grammax-creeper

#### Gravefist

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A pale white mushroom with five knobby protrusions, the mushroom often resembles a skeletal hand reaching upward. When the mushroom grows in clusters, it appears as if numerous corpses are attempting to reach out of the soil. The fungus predominantly grows in the Underdark; however, it has also been seen in dark basements and unused root cellars. Several tales of superstition follow the fungus, many believing that if it appears in rooms below your house, someone will soon die in the residence. This may be partially due to the fact that the mushrooms release toxic spores that slowly inflict 4d8 poison damage over 2d8 days to people that sleep or live within 100 feet of this fungus for that period of time. 

^gravefist

#### Green-Air Bramble

Biome: Mountains

Fast-growing creeping vine that sprouts green berries and a small number of thorns. Can grow in most inhospitable climates and only needs to be in moist soil for 6 hours per week. Exposure to poison quickly kills the plant, causing leaves and berries to wilt and die. Carrying 3 feet’s worth of vine grants +2 bonus to Constitution saves against inhaled poisons, airborne diseases and nauseating effects like stinking cloud. 

^green-air-bramble

#### Grendar

Biome: Arctic

A small, hardy, ground-creeping vine, spreading in several dozen tendrils of no more than 18” in the harsh conditions of the tundra. Cures skin irritations and rashes in one day, itching will be subdued. 

^grendar

#### Grim Flowers

Biome: Plains and Cities

These dark violet flowers are often found at the edges of graveyards and sites of massive battles. Those that tend gravesites often call them “Death Trumpets” for their shape, and they emit a smell similar to that of a corpse. Thus, when such flowers are noticed, they are often pulled up by the root, to remove such an unpleasant odor. However, despite their terrible odor, it is believed by followers of Kelemvor and Bane that should you die with the seeds of this plant in your possession, your spirit will find an easier path to the afterlife. Thus, many keep the seeds of such a flower in a cloth bag close to their chest. Unfortunately for others, this means that the flowers often sprout from the corpse several days after the death of such individuals. 

^grim-flowers

#### Guardseye

Biome: Mountains

This 40-cm high perennial has smooth, dark blue leaves and a woody stem. It has white, cuplike flowers, with purple flecks on the inside. In autumn, the plant dies except for a thick root than can be up to 50 cm long, but even dead, it does not shed its leaves. When cooked in water, the resulting tea will grant the drinker the ability to detect all life forms within 500 m. This includes hidden, invisible, phased, ethereal and similarly affected creatures. The effect last for a full 6 hours. 

^guardseye

#### Guklulla

Biome: Swamps

Growing in the swamps, the plant appears to be little more than a pair of large, broad leaves floating on the surface of the stagnant water. During warmer months, a large yellow flower blossoms in the midst of the two leaves. Hidden beneath the surface, the plant has an extensive root system that reaches far down into the muck in a massive tangle that catches debris carried along by the slow current. Various species of fish and snakes lay their eggs in the tangle of roots. Various orc tribes harvest the Guklulla for the roots, pulling the plants out of the muck, cutting off sections of the roots and throwing them back into the swamp to be harvested again in the future. Grinding the root into a paste and applying it to wounds provides not only accelerated healing (+4 when using hit dice during a short rest. If the recipient of the healing is an orc or half-orc, they receive an additional 1d4 hit points.), but also numbs the affected area. 

^guklulla

#### Gulthias Tree

Biome: Forests and Jungles

A severely evil tree that came to be when a vampire was staked to the ground with a stake that was still green and took root. Undead typically flock to the singular tree located somewhere in a dark corner of the largest forest of Faerun, and seem to gain some form of power from it. (Can be used as a storypoint or worldbuilder for DM’s).

#### Gylvir

Biome: Oceans

Gylvir is an algae that grows in sheets of blue or teal. When eaten it allows a person to breathe underwater (and only underwater) for a period of four hours.

#### Gyumin Beans

Biome: Plains

A small plant that grows close to the ground, the stalks are a mottled green color, and the soft oval leaves grow in small clumps. During harvest time, the plants are laden with several long pods filled with up to a dozen light brown beans. Farmers often grow the beans alongside rows of corn, as the plants seem to complement one another. The beans are often either eaten cooked, or ground into a fine paste and eaten with bread. Several restaurants and taverns across Faerun are known for their particular methods of preparing Gyumin Paste. H
