#### Haella

Biome: Plains and Cities

Growing in clumps, these tall purple flowers are often planted in tranquil gardens and are commonly seen on gently rolling fields. The stalks bear symmetrical pairs of long tapered leaves with purple veins. Farmers dislike the plants because they tend to choke out food crops, such as corn. The flowers emit a subtle and sweet fragrance which not only smells nice, but also is a repellant to certain predatory insects, such as mosquitoes and dragonflies. Those that can afford to pay for it often rub Haella Fragrance on their unprotected skin during warmer months to repel such vermin (-5 to rolls for initiative for Insectoids).

#### Halcyon Crocus

Biome: Arctic

In the highland meadows of the Dalelands grows a pale white-silver crocus. By starlight, nectar can be harvested from its simple bloom and dried into snuff that engulfs the user in bittersweet recollections of yore. With each dose of the Halcyon Snuff the user remembers a spell forgotten, effectively allowing him or her to cast it again without expending a spell slot. However, other memories linger uninvited to forever haunt and burden the user of this drug. Each dose inflicts 2d6 o psychic damage after the initial effect.

#### Hands of Laretha

Biome: Forests and Plains

Stems of bright green hold jagged leaves that grow in clusters of three. The plant grows delicate yellow flowers that smell pleasant, with the smell often drifting in the breeze on warm summer nights. The golden flowers that blossom from the plant grow to resemble a pair of hands pressed together. A common belief is that the flower resembled the hands of Laretha, a young cleric of Tymora, while she prayed to the gods to save her from misfortune at the hands of a horde of bandits. Her prayers were answered by the arrival of a group of adventurers. Afterward the flowers appeared near her shrine, a sign that the goddess was looking over her. Commonly used by paladins and clerics, the flowers grant a +3 to any religion checks when worn as a crown or behind the ear.

#### Hangman Tree

Biome: Forests and Jungles

A deciduous tree named for the noose-like ropy appendages that hang down from the branches, the trees are known to entrap the unwary. Their shallow roots and sparse leaves require the tree to seek nutrition through being carnivorous. The main body of the trunk has a hollow tube containing a digestive acid. The ropy appendages drag trapped prey upward and drops them inside the opening. The opening is surrounded by a number of downward facing spines which make escape difficult. Due to the shallow roots, the trees may move at a glacial pace, allowing most prey to easily outrun them. However, the trees rely upon a perfume their leaves emit that causes hallucinations to lure potential victims closer. Upon an encounter, PC’s must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save or be lured in to the tree’s appendages. The character must then make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity save to avoid taking 8d6 acid damage. Tree can be attacked as well:

#### Harlequin’s Harp

Biome: Coastal and Cities

A multi-colored flower ranging between yellow and purple and everywhere in between with several strands of fiber attached to the petals across the empty space in the center of the flower. A few decades ago, an herbalist found that strumming the fibers would hold a tune, and since then, the flowers have become a common gift for friends and loved ones. Some talented herbalists have learned to breed the Harlequin’s Harps in a way that the fibers can be tuned to specific notes for personalized gifts.

#### Harpy Nest

Biome: Forests and Jungles

The mottled trunk of these trees is often seen growing in rocky soil. The upper limbs of the tree curve inward upon the trunk, and become a large tangled mass. Various flying creatures, predominantly harpies, often cultivate the top of the tree, tearing away enough limbs in the center to form a protective nest. From the ground it is difficult to notice any creatures dwelling among the tangles, allowing cunning creatures to dive down and ambush their prey. The massive roots of the tree, while edible, are tough and require several hours of soaking in boiling water. Once prepared properly, the taste is said to be similar to salted potatoes.

Biome: Jungles

A green, leafy plant whose leaves are tinged with a deep purple. The leaves are commonly dried and smoked or cultivated and harvested for this purpose by criminal organizations.

#### Hart’s Crown

Biome: Forests

This odd bush grows in deep forests, where men often fear to tread because of dark and wild fey creatures. The bush grows strong curved branches that resemble the antlers of a deer, and in their center, they grow a single purple flower. Legend has it that the plant was originally created to help combat the Unseelie fey, ages ago. However, through trickery and guile, the dark fey managed to destroy many of the plants not in their possession, or not hidden deep within their realms. The flower can be consumed for two main purposes: often sought out by those undertaking a vow of celibacy, consumption of the flower reduces libido for 2d6 days. In addition, the consumption of the flower hides the recipient from being tracked by fey for the same period of time.

#### Hate Gartlet

Biome: Plains and Forests

A bright, crimson-red flower atop an impossibly thin green stalk.

#### Heather

Biome: Plains

A fairly common flowering shrub with purple flowers that produces small berries in warm spring months. Heather was once used by the singular village of Brookstead to create a spectacularly rare and wonderfully tasting heather mead. The village was pillaged and plundered by a rogue sect of dwarves and the few survivors were hounded for their recipe. For the most part, the villagers did not part with their recipe and the secret of heather mead is now lost to the ages. Whether or not any survivors went on to make more is still a mystery, but every now and then, a bottle of heather mead will pop up in a small, far-off market, fetching an exorbitant price.

#### Helmthorne

Biome: Mountains

A vine-like shrub, often growing in remote and desolate locations, the shrub has dark green leaves, and sprouts indigo colored berries. The shrub is named due to long black thorns that protect the plant from various foraging animals. The berries are often harvested to be eaten, or can be fermented to make Helmthorn Wine. On occasion a plant will produce red berries, which are seen as a symbol of good luck, and make a slightly sweeter vintage of wine. The wine is considered sacred to many practicing clerics (capable of restoring an expended spell slot for a cleric that consumes the wine) and the berries can be used with the spell Goodberry, and these berries will instead restore 2 hit points per berry and last for an additional day.

#### Hidden Hibiscus

Biome: Forests and Jungles

A large, woody, flowering shrub, the hidden hibiscus grows from 6' to 8' high, and as much as 10' wide. The blooms of the hibiscus are large (easily the size of a human hand), plentiful, and many colored. Bloom colors are typically red with yellow ribs, or pink with dark red ribs, but some sages claim there are thousands of different color combinations and variations. If a Hidden Hibiscus is threatened, or detects rapid movement nearby, any blooms on the bush immediately change their color to drab greens and browns, and the entire plant appears to wilt and wither. Skilled alchemists use the roots of the Hidden Hibiscus to amplify their creations that aid in natural camouflage (adding wilted hidden hibiscus to armor will negate any stealth penalties that the armor normally has), but the blooms of the hibiscus are its true prize as they can be used to dramatically increase both physical and mental speed for short periods of time (+2 bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence stats for 1d4+1 hours). Only brightly colored blooms can be used in these speed-increasing concoctions, and once a Hidden Hibiscus changes the color of one of its blooms, they never change back.

#### Hiexel

Biome: Forests

This tree has silvery-green bark covering a sparse collection of branches which curve upward to support vibrantly green leaves which turn dark red in autumn. The wood is an odd hue of green, and unfortunately not dense enough to be useful in construction. However, burning the wood creates a large quantity of smoke, which is often used to smoke meat or to create signal fires (or to create clouds of smoke that can be used for escape and distraction). The bark is useful after rendering it down to create a thick green paste which is often sought after to seal buildings against the cold winds of winter. 

^hiexel

#### Hiljirat Pepper

Biome: Plains, Jungles, and Forests

A small plant that has many branches, each which end in a single triangular leaf, the peppers that also grow on the plant are much sought after for their spice. The peppers are either dried or ground into powder after being picked, allowing them to be shipped afar with little chance of spoilage. The wealthy of the cities of the Sword Coast enjoy the taste of the peppers, and several sailing merchants pay exorbitant amounts to have the peppers harvested and shipped.

#### Hoggle Beans

Biome: Arctic

A single leafy stalk with a tough exterior that grows in gentle rolling fields of the Dalelands, the plant produces numerous pods upon reaching maturity. Within each pod are small pink beans, each one almost perfectly spherical. Most large herbivores, such as cattle and goats, avoid the plant, as it has a detrimental effect. Herbalists and healers often seek the plant out because the beans are a strong laxative, requiring a DC 15 Consitution saving throw after being ingested to avoid the unpleasant effects.
