#### Iazutl

Biome: Plains

Growing in clusters, the flower has a long stalk, which has a single oval leaf at the very top of the plant. The leaf points toward the rising sun, and blows in anything more than a light breeze. During warmer months, the plant blossoms numerous small crimson flowers. Those that venerate Kiltzi speak tales of the Iazutl flower. One tale speaks of the plant growing singularly, and without flowers, and when Kiltzi noticed the plant was all alone, she wept. Her tears caused several similar plants to grow in the area, and as an expression of their love for her, they sprouted an abundance of flowers. Lovers often gift the flowers to one another, as a sign of their affection. The flowers are also typically presented to the bride by the groom on the night before the wedding in Sword Coast wedding ceremonies.

#### Iceflower

Biome: Arctic

A short plant, the stalk bears a number of feathery leaves, and a single flower blooms, bearing shades of blue. The plant is only seen in areas of abundant snow, and oddly seems to thrive where other plants would perish. The plant is only seen during the summer months, when there is considerable sunlight, and in winter months it withers and dies. Beneath the surface of the snow, the iceflower has an extensive root system that grows very quickly. The roots are durable enough that some of the northern tribes will dig them up to serve as a foundation for a roof over small circular huts. In addition, some nomadic tribes of the Dalelands have found that by placing iceflower roots under the armor, soldiers have found that they will be immune to overheating and gain +1 AC.

#### Ironhard

Biome: Forests

This 2-foot-high plant has dark blue leaves with a thick white hair growth on the underside. It grows all summer and the first half of autumn, and has many small yellow 6 leaved flowers. The plant has a milky white sap, which can be rubbed onto the skin, hardening it and granting a +1 AC bonus for one hour. Repeated and frequent use will cause the skin to lose some of its natural elasticity and cause a -1 AC penalty (after use of Ironhard 5 times within 1 week).
