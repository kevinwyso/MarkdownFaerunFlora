#### Jabberweed

Biome: Jungles

Tenacious and ugly root-plant native to jungle environs that looks like a pocked, skeletal hand. These pock-marks are actually small holes that cause a low hissing sound, caused by the plant’s ability to capture wind in these holes, audible to 100 ft (DC 15 listen to notice sound and direction) that imposes a -4 penalty to other listen checks (for the party and against the party). If kept wrapped in moist cloth it survives for 1 week, but DC 18 Nature check can keep it alive for another week.

#### Jaffray

Biome: Plains, Jungles, and Forests

A clove-like herb that is normally ground up and sprinkled into other dishes or drinks as flavoring, Jaffray acts as a mild aphrodisiac, increasing sexual interest and general sensitivity to the surroundings. Face flushes, pupils dilate, breathing quickens, and skin becomes preternaturally sensitive. The herb has a mildly cinnamon-like flavor and its potency is not affected by being cooked. The herb is also sometimes used to counteract suspected poisoning, since it increases resistance to poison yet is so common as to be inoffensive if added to a meal.

#### Jelly Moss (Ogre Snot)

Biome: Plains, Jungles, and Underdark/Caves

It is said that when a representative of the Martel Company brought the first samples of Jelly Moss back to Banuvo's College of Mysteries, it nearly caused a riot among the academics. The resident sages were unable to conclusively determine if this clump of grayish-purple tube-like structures, smelling a bit like rotten pears, was a plant or a fungus. It was known that Jelly Moss, when crushed, becomes very messy and sticky, but until an unlucky professor sat a small sample of Jelly Moss that’d been left on his chair, no one had realized this goo would create an almost instant, permanent, bond of incredible strength with wood. The battle of classification rapidly transformed into a full-blown war between the Blacksmith's Guild and the Carpenters over the future of nails.

#### Juniper

Biome: Forests, Plains, and Cities

The Juniper tree can grow up to ten feet in height. It is an evergreen, which has prickly stiff foliage. The berries appear in early summer, but take roughly three years to ripen to the stage where they are useful. Unripe berries are green, ripe ones are bluish-black in colour. Because of this rather long period of ripening, it is wise to never denude a tree of berries. A normal sized tree will have between 100 and 200 ripe berries. 15 of these berries should be crushed and mixed with boiling water. When the liquid has cooled, the infusion should then be drunk in order to relieve status effects temporarily (3d4 hours). This liquid will only keep for a month under normal conditions, but can be mixed with an alcoholic spirit to increase its lifespan indefinitely. According to the traditions of some northern nomads, a sprig of juniper kept in a house would protect the inhabitants from vampire attacks. This may actually work at the DM’s discretion.
