#### Kaitlin’s Weed

Biome: Plains

A short leafy stalk that grows fine red hairs along the prominent bud, it is often mistaken for the taller Dragon’s Breath.

#### Karcatta Brambles

Biome: Deserts

Growing in deep ravines and shadowy places of the desert, the brambles grow along the ground, rarely achieving waist height. The stems are covered in long, spiny thorns, and the plant grows wide leaves close to the ground. In the cooler months the plant blossoms with flowers of various colors. The leaves, once dried, are often smoked by nomadic tribes during religious rituals. The dried leaves are rolled together and lit, or used as incense. Those that inhale the smoke have auditory hallucinations, often of imperceptible whispers, although some are capable of discerning what is being said and declare that it is the voice of the divines giving them directions.

#### King’s Pear

Biome: Forests

A somewhat common tree growing to typically around 20 feet tall, King’s Pear is a light brown, smooth-barked fruit tree that produces first large white flowers in the early spring, followed by fist sized fruits resembling orange pears. The pears can be eaten normally and taste refreshingly of citrus mixed with apple. However, the seeds of the King’s Pear can be crushed and distilled with alcohol to draw out the seed’s poisonous compounds. The resulting solution is a milky white color and smells slightly of cooked meat. After ingestion, the recipient must make a DC 15 Cons. Save vs. poison. On a failed save, the target begins to experience headaches and visual/auditory hallucinations, and the target takes 3d8 psychic damage and loses one point from wisdom. On a successful save, the target takes only have the psychic damage and has no secondary effect. The resulting hallucinations often cause the recipient to see things twist and warp into the shapes of vile and hideous monsters, seeking to cause them harm. Those under the poison’s effects often lash out at those around them. Few people survive the initial hallucinatory period due to the sheer horror of the experience, but those that do go on to retain the paranoia that those around them could also shift into hideous creatures once again.

#### Kingsfruit

Biome: Forests

The bark of this tree is smooth, and a rich brown in color while the soft leaves are oval shaped and grow in small clusters. During the warmer months, small violet flowers grow from the tree. During the autumn months, the tree produces a dark brown fruit with a tough exterior. The fruit has an extremely hard rind, and require a blow from a hammer to open. Striking either end of the fruit causes the rind to cleanly split into six equal parts. The inside of the fruit is a shade of golden yellow, and is quite sweet. Eating the fruit restores hit points equal to two of your hit dice and restores any hit dice expended from short rests.

#### Kinuka Tree

During most of the year, the tree bears a multitude of feathery red leaves that turn purple in the fall. In the spring the tree is punctuated by small clusters of white flowers.

#### Korogg

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Korogg is a rare underdark fungus that typically grows on the corpses of dead miners and dwarves who aren’t properly buried. Black, bulbous bodies with fine black mycelia produce a fungal fruit called Korogg Pods, which can then be reduced to their juice and distilled. This rich liquor is sought after for its taste and smell. When a character imbibes Korogg Liquor, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save. The liquor quells freethinking: no person who drinks it need make an Investigation check while under its influence for the duration of a day, as the result will incur a -8 penalty since they can’t think of anything their investigation might mean, and the consumer takes a -1d6 penalty to wisdom checks after consumption until the next long rest.

#### Krakaem Pods

Biome: Swamps and Jungles

Growing off of tree branches, at first inspection this fungus appears to be the cocoon of an insect. The fungus is intrusive, sending tendrils into the tree branches and stealing water reserves. Sporadically another pod will emerge from the tree branch, swell to the size of a human fist, and then burst, sending a cloud of black spores floating on the wind. The spores are a severe irritant and may even cause temporary blindness if a large mass of spores get into the eyes of a creature (DC 12 Constitution Save if within 15 feet of the tree). The pods are also sought after for food, as frying them in oil and serving them with fish is a delicacy served in Waterdeep.

#### Kylathar (Changeberry)

Biome: Forests

Anyone who eats the yellow, soft, plum sized fruits instantly has two random stats exchanged; Strength with Constitution, Wisdom with Dexterity; anything is possible (the DM should determine which statistics are exchanged). There is no saving throw, and no cure (DM’s discretion). Eating more of the berries will simply cause more stats to be randomly exchanged. Short of magical storage, the fruits will spoil and rot within 2 days after plucking. The bush itself grows about 2 meters high, with long, dusty green leaves, which are slightly sawed. The flowers grow in groups of 4 to 8, and are yellowish white with orange edges. The flowers grow in late spring, the fruits are ripe in autumn. L
