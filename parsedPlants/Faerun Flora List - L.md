#### Laishaberries (Fruit of Silence)

Biome: Plains and Forests

Laishaberries grow on dark green, knee-high bushes. The leaves of the bushes are hard and waxy, and stay on long into autumn, sometimes even into winter. Concealed under the leaves, the red, cherry sized berries grow in spring and early summer, developing from small, fragrant, wax blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The berries taste quite bland themselves, although they can be used to add a special taste to all kinds of jellies. When ripe, the berries can be eaten raw, and will each heal 2 hp of damage, or speed the recovery from most diseases. However, they will also render the eater mute for 20 minutes for each berry eaten. Also, if more than 5 or 6 berries are eaten at a time, a DC 12 Cons. saving throw vs poison is required to avoid severe and somewhat debilitating stomach cramps that will incur a -2 penalty to Dexterity saves and checks for 1d3 hours. A jelly made from the berries themselves loses both the healing and silencing powers (and the danger of cramps) of the fresh berries, but the curative effects for most diseases is doubled; fresh berries reduce the recovery time by one day for each berry eaten, the jelly halves the total time.

These fruits cannot be dried and will rot within two weeks of picking. However, the juice of three fruits can be mixed with olive (or other vegetable) oil, and left to stand for a week. This oil has an almost unlimited life.

#### Lashar

Biome: Rivers

A grey, slightly slimy lichen that grows on rocks in the middle of streams. When ground up into a slurry and consumed, it will slow the effects of poison for 2 hours, resulting in half damage taken from poisons in that time and putting off the poisoned effect until the slurry works its way through the body. After that the poison will resolve normally, unless another potion is drunk. The slimy concoction is very repulsive, and a DC 14 Constitution saving throw is needed to see if the imbiber can actually hold it down. 

^lashar

#### Laspar

Biome: Forests

A squat evergreen tree with dusty green bark, and olive-green needles that grow in clusters, most people avoid burning the wood of the tree. Setting the wood ablaze resulted in a large number of sparks, which potentially could set houses ablaze, due to the high amount of pitch contained within the wood. The needles, which grow in “shags” at the end of each branch, are often used in special torches which burn for 2 hours. The needles are also often burned simply for the deep piney aroma they provide.

#### Latimer Orchid

Biome: Plains

A yellow-orange orchid flower commonly farmed and sold illegally. The pollen of the flower can be turns into a sticky, rich-smelling powder that can be applied to the gums and tongue. When consumed in this way, it brings about a mild hallucinatory state for 4 hours, wherein the recipient's capacity for visualization and imagination are increased. The powder is used recreationally by many, including by those of an artistic bent, but it is members of the Illusion school of magic who benefit most from its effects. Due to the greater precision and depth of imagination produced, all illusions created by one under the influence of the yellow powder gain a boon to their typical effects, be it increased save DC’s, increased damage, or increased defensive properties. The yellow powder is not addictive, but it can lead to a detrimental state of internalization and paranoia. Any session where a character uses the yellow powder, he must make a Wisdom check on 1d20. A roll of above their Wisdom score results in an episode of paranoia some time during the session (at the DM's discretion).

#### Light of Mystra

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Small mushrooms with thick heads; the outer skin is a pale blue color, and the head is often covered in small off-color bumps. In the darkness the mushrooms glow, attracting creatures to consume the fungus. Within the bumps of the cap, the mushroom holds a dense collection of spores. After digesting and passing the mushroom, the spores begin to sprout. The glow of the mushrooms is slightly magical, and casting Detect Magic reveals a pale aura of illusion magic, illusion that causes people to believe that they’re much tastier than they actually are. Some say that the mushroom was blessed by Mystra, to help her followers find their way out of the Underdark.

#### Lizard Eaters

Biome: Plains and Cities

A hardy vine that grows easily in the nooks and crannies of brick and mortar structures and can often be found in older cities or in ruins. The vine rapidly grows along the crevasses provided by mortar, and every few feet a small yellow flower sprouts from the vine, surrounded by a handful of apparently errant tendrils. These flowers smell very faintly like rotting meat, which is used to attract vermin such as small lizards and rats. When the vermin begin to eat the flower, the tendrils quickly close around the creature, slowly constricting and choking the life from the creature. This feature causes many urban dwelling folks to not only tolerate the presence of the vine, but to also encourage such growth.

3 successes or 2 successes and 1 failure will return to character to full health, fully living. 2 failures and 1 success will return the character to conscious undeath, returning the player as a revenant. 3 failures will return the character as a full undead, with the helpful intervention of an evil deity of death, returning the character as a Death Knight with no control over their actions.
