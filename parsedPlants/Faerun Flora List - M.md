#### Maiden’s Hair (Earthsilk)

Biome: Forests and Underdark/Caves

An odd mushroom cultivated by dwarves for the silken tendrils that hang from it and collect moisture. These tendrils are tough and time-consuming to harvest, but they can be made into a very tough silk that can then be made into tough rope and shirts or woven into existing armor that then grants extra resistance to bludgeoning and slashing, although the fabric can be torn by a piercing damage critical hit, at which point it loses its properties until repaired. Crafting with Maiden’s Hair requires a DC Nature Check of 25+ or consultation with a Dwarven master craftsman.

#### Maitake Mushroom

Biome: Forests

A feathery, light brown mushroom, found growing wild in forests and very difficult to cultivate. The maitake is a mild, tasty mushroom, and can be used to increase immune efficacy. The word maitake is literally translated as "dancing mushroom." According to herbal folklore, it was so named because in ancient times people who found maitake could exchange it for its weight in silver, leading to their dancing in celebration.

#### Makebate

Biome: Plains

This herb works very rapidly against damage poisons from common pests including snakes, spiders, and scorpions, quickly running through the body and absorbing any left-over poison from the blood if applied within 2 rounds of being poisoned. Removes the poison effect but does not heal for any of the damage the poison has actually done.

#### Mallow

Biome: Plains

A tall plant with many star shaped leaves sprouting from the main stalk, the mallow plant is notable for the large five petal white flowers. Several tribes of nomadic people use the flowers for decoration, especially during fertility ceremonies. The Azuposi people brew a tea from the plant, said to ward away any “evil spirits” (Those that drink the tea gain Advantage on any saving throw meant to resist mind control or possession until the next short rest). 

^mallow

#### Mallus

Biome: Plains

A tiny sprouting ground plant that produces a singular golden, bell-shaped flower in the late summer. After crushing this flower and inhaling the subsequent pollen that erupts, which smells slightly of sour apple, the recipient must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is affected for 10 minutes as if the spell Suggestion was cast on them, meaning that they will accomplish simple tasks if even hinted at. 

^mallus

#### Mandrake

Biome: Jungles

The root of this herb sends the recipient to sleep. The sleep will last 15 hours, during which time the person cannot be woken except by a Protection from Poison spell or potion. The root is said to bear a resemblance to the naked male form, hence its name. The plant has several dark green leaves which are about 1-foot long. The purple flowers of the plant are bell shaped. The root of the plant must be boiled on the night of a full moon and left to sit for an entire month before use. According to ancient legend, the sun god, Re-Horakhty, sent one of his chosen heroes to earth to punish mankind. The hero’s slaughter was so intense, that Re took pity on man, and forced the hero to drink the blood of his victims mixed with Mandrake root. He fell asleep and when he awoke was unable to remember why he had come to earth, and so the slaughter was ended.

#### Maracan

Biome: Deserts

Resembling a dead wood shrub, Maraca subsists off of magical energy found within the earth and therefore does not grow leaves, and the slightest amount of water will drown it. Branches of maraca can be snapped off, dried, and grated under the light of a full moon into a fine powder that faintly glows. When a dose of the dust is thrown on a target, it will negate the saving throws for the next spell on him. An attack roll must be made against unwilling targets that know that the caster is up to something. This powder is also known as magedust and can fetch pretty hefty prices at market. 

^maracan

#### Maraga Flowers

Biome: Plains and Jungles

Growing as a small bush with broad, heart shaped leaves, the plant also grows vibrant red-and-violet flowers. The bush also emits an enticing scent that almost overpowers the smell of the plant’s decaying prey. The insides of the flowers are lined with a number of sharp thorns, and each flower is capable of spraying a paralytic poison at potential prey (DC 15 Cons. Save if within 5 feet of the plant or suffer 3d6 poison damage. If the target creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they are Paralyzed for 1d4 hours). Once the prey falls to the ground, the bush is capable of slowly moving due to having shallow roots, and entangling the paralyzed creature. The root system slowly crushes the prey, and the bush feeds upon the nutrients as the body decays. 

^maraga-flowers

#### Marigold

Biome: Plains and Forests

Marigold can grow to a height of two feet and has rows of flat orange and yellow petals around a central disc. These flowers must be dried and then mixed with olive or other vegetable oil to produce a soothing balm which will soothe and clean small wounds, in order to prevent infection. As a side effect, the marigold has a slightly musky scent that attracts beasts, and granting a +2 to Animal Handling checks as well as +2 to rolls for initiative from beasts for 1d8 hours. 

^marigold

#### Marisia

Biome: Plains

A small, gnarled tree found in temperate plain environments with bright pink leaves, the leaves are commonly ground into a drug well-known amongst spellcasters called Memory Dust. Taken as a snuff, the dust gives a magic-user the ability to memorize and cast a single spell of the level above his normal maximum (for example, a 1st level magic-user could memorize and gain a slot for a single 2nd level spell) until the next long rest. The dust is highly addictive. After every session in which a magic-user has made use of the dust, he must make a Wis. check on 1d20. If the roll results in a number higher than his Wis. score, the character will do everything he can to use the dust again in the next session, paying sometimes exorbitant prices. A roll of 20 indicates that the character's tolerance for the dust has increased, and from now on he must consume twice the quantity to achieve the same effect. 

^marisia

#### Marjoram

#### Marsh Maw

Biome: Swamps

Lurking beneath the stagnant water of swamps across the realm waits a plant made of veiny tendrils looking to fill a spine-filled maw. When unsuspecting prey wanders nearby, the tendrils snake around flailing limbs, dragging it into the maw. The plant slowly submerges back beneath the surface, crushing the prey caught within its grasp. The Marsh Maw is a danger that dwells within shallow swamps, using the brackish water as camouflage. The plant has a deep root system that goes deep, holding the monstrosity in place. The Maw often lurks at the edges of the swamp, near where herd animals come to drink. More than a few unlucky shepherds have lost members of their flock to the danger that lurks just beneath the surface.

^marshmallow

#### Maruera

Biome: Rivers and Forests

In appearance this small tree looks much like any other excpt in minature. It can be identified by its vivid green leaves. These leaves when chewed produce large amounts of oxygen from the carbon dioxide already in the persons breath. One leaf may be chewed for up to ten minutes, before its properties are exhausted. The leaves are often boiled down to an essential oil, and the resultant infusion added to starchy natural substances to produce a gum. A piece of this gum will allow the recipient to survive without oxygen for 2d4 x 10 minutes, provided they are conscious and able to chew. The herbs main use is in allowing the recipient to survive in oxygen poor or free environments such as underground. When a tree is found it will normally have 5d10 leaves. Taking too many leaves can harm the tree. The tree has a chance of dying equal to the percentage of the leaves taken. For example, if 30% of the leaves are taken the tree has a 30% chance of dying, if 50% are taken it has a 50% chance of dying. The leaves are also said to have a calming effect when chewed (DM’s discretion).

#### Meadow Giant

Biome: Plains

Tenacious, large green-stemmed weed that can spring up overnight in temperate grasslands, plains and farmlands. It easily threatens crops, and its powdered stem can be made into an anticoagulant called White Sanguine, which when added to an injury poison, causes the victim to bleed for 1 point of damage each round for one minute if it fails a DC 15 Constitution save against the poison.

^melander

#### Midnight Coneflower

Biome: Mountains

An incredibly rare flower found on mountainous peaks that only blooms on a blue moon, sprouting from the ground into a shiny, white plate-sized flower, and retracting back into the ground before dawn. The petals of this flower can be ground into a fine white powder used in the creation of two separate, but equally deadly poisons. 

If the powder of the Midnight Cone petals is combined with the Midnight Cone’s Nectar, the two can be mixed to create a sweet smelling, sweet tasting syrup that becomes inert when ingested. However, this process creates a powerful, delayedresponse contact poison called Goodbye Kiss. Typical application sees the flower’s pure nectar applied to the assassin’s lips as a protective barrier followed by an application of the Goodbye Kiss syrup, and then the assassin giving the target a kiss. A creature subjected to this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw vs. poison, taking 13d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, the Midnight Cone Flower’s petals can be made into Midnight Tears, an equally potent ingested poison. Many nobles have died peacefully in their sleep while their loved ones lay nearby, falling to the effects of a dose of Midnight Tears administered by a stealthy assassin many hours before. The only side-effect of the poison, that can very easily be missed in investigation, is the presence of the white, pearlescent tears that the poison is named for, seeping from the recipient’s eyes as if they were crying in their sleep. Again, a creature subjected to this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw vs. poison, taking 13d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Mistletoe

Biome: Forests and Arctic

Mistletoe is a parasitic evergreen shrub that grows mostly in copses of other evergreens. Mistletoe has long been a sacred herb to druids, and branches of mistletoe have been hung from the ceilings to ward off evil spirits for centuries. The origin of kissing under the mistletoe comes from an age-old story of the deities, that Eldath, the goddess of peace was nearly slain with an arrow made of a mistletoe branch. When she was revived from the brink of death, the mistletoe was then turned over to the domain of Sune, the goddess of love and she vowed that whenever anyone passed under a branch of mistletoe they would kiss to illustrate that mistletoe had become a symbol of love and not of hate. 

^mistletoe

#### Mokodo Bush

Biome: Plains and Cities

This full body bush grows a plentiful amount of waxy green leaves, that turn pink in the fall. During warmer months the bush sprouts flowers of yellow and orange, which turn into sweet little berries. The leaves and berries of the bush can be harvested and rendered down to create a waxy resin that is often used to seal the hulls of seagoing boats, replacing pitch. The practice is far from common, as the process to create the resin is far more expensive than using the traditional methods. Some seamstresses also coat their threads in the resin, which allows for the creation of finer garments. These garments represent armored fine clothing, the appearance of fine clothes with the protection of light armor (AC 11+Dexterity Mod).

#### Mother’s Mercy

Biome: Mountains

Mother’s Mercy very closely resembles the plant Mother’s Worry except for the presence of the small, white blooms that are present on Mother’s Mercy during the late spring and early summer. A tall, woody-stemmed plant that when broken releases copious amounts of a thin, milky fluid. When the sap of Mother’s Mercy is refined to a slightly thicker milky fluid, it becomes a peaceful but powerful poison. After ingestion, a creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned on a failed save, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. While poisoned in this way, the creature's Constitution score decreases by 2. On each successive failed save, the creature's Constitution score is further reduced by 1. If a creature's Constitution score if reduced to 0 in this way, it dies. After two consecutive successful saves, the poisoning ends and the creature's Constitution score is restored. 

^mothers-mercy

#### Mother’s Worry

Biome: Mountains

Mother’s Worry very closely resembles the plant Mother’s Mercy except for the presence of the small, white blooms that are present on Mother’s Mercy during the late spring and early summer. A tall, woody-stemmed plant that when broken releases copious amounts of a thin, milky fluid. By harvesting this liquid and evaporating away the excess water, Mother’s Worry can be turned into a mild poison that causes the rapid onset of unconsciousness via constriction of the airways. Upon ingestion, the recipient must make a DC 12 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 poison damage and falls unconscious for 1d6 hours. On a successful save, the target instead takes only one half of the poison damage with no secondary effect.

The few leaves that sprout from the stalk are a lighter shade of grey with dark veins running through them. Every few hours the flowers of the plant open, and appear very similar to white moths. When the flowers are open, the plant emits a strange smell which causes goblinoids to retch. Any goblinoid (including Kobolds, Goblins, Bugbears, and Hobgoblins) approaching within 20 feet of the plant must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become nauseous. Flowers that have been picked do not confer the same effect.
