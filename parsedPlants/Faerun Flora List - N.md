#### Nahre Lotus

Biome: Rivers

A waterlily native to large bodies of fresh water. Harvesting the plant and putting it in a vial creates a splash weapon against enemies, working as a minor form of the spell Tsunami (wall of water up to 10 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. On a failed save, damage is 2d10 Bludgeoning damage).

#### Napweed

Biome: Plains

This plant has a single main stem with small fern like leaves, and small pink flowers growing from it. These flowers must be dried, powdered, and mixed into wine and then drunk to counter the effect of damage poisons. A successful application means that only half normal damage is taken from the poison if consumed before poisoning. In addition to this use, the flower is often counted as a symbol of faith between lovers and is used to decorate and garnish foods at weddings. According to Greek mythology, this plant was used by the centaur who, when wounded by Hercules with an arrow poisoned with the Hydra's blood, treated himself with it.

#### Nararoot

Biome: Plains

A tuber found throughout Faerun, the green and purple leaves of the plant grow close to the ground, and a single thin stalk sprouts upward to reveal a flower with two wide petals. The root is often cut into shavings and either eaten directly, or brewed into a tea. Although terribly bitter, it primarily serves as a form of birth control, as ingesting it renders a person infertile for several weeks.

#### Navew

Biome: Plains and Cities

The seeds of Navew dropped in a drink or on to food before it is eaten acts as counteragent to ingested poisons. It prevents the death of a person poisoned in that meal, though they may still be very ill.

#### Nettle

Biome: Plains and Rivers

A common ground-cover plant that grows in wide open places and occasionally marshy environments. Apart from wanting to avoid the plants due to their stinging hairs, the leaves of nettle plants can be used in teas and ointments treating conditions ranging from constipation to skin disease to excess bleeding. Aside from its common uses, Nettle is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.

#### Nightcall

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A blue-grey herb smelling faintly of nutmeg that heightens the user's senses. Over-dosage or prolonged usage causes photosensitivity, distraction and nervousness; on the other hand, prolonged usage can also make the effects permanent. Nightcall gradually dyes the long-term user's hair, teeth, nails, horns, or scales midnight blue. (The minimum dose of 1 tsp gives the eater +100' sight range, +10% hearing, and +1 to Wisdom and Dexterity scores for up to 1d8 hours. Up to 4 doses will stack, but after the second dose, the user will make a DC 14 Wisdom Save. This DC increases by one after every dosage. If failed, the user becomes addicted and loses -100’ sight range (down to 3’), -10% hearing, and -1 to Wisdom and Dexterity scores while not under Nightcal’’s effects.)

#### Nightmare Root

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Nightmare Root is a woody, tuberous plant that grows in deep Underdark locations, sprouting up from even lower places in the abyss. The root can be ground into a fine paste that, although tasteless and without odor, adds the texture of very fine sand to a dish it is added to. Those that consume nightmare root often find themselves plagued by haunting dreams upon falling asleep. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw vs poison. On a failed save, the creature's sleep is haunted with a combination of their greatest fears and everything they've ever done wrong. After these fears are presented, the strong willed and wise can overcome the surface horror of these dreams and attempt a DC 20 Wisdom Save vs fear. If this save is failed, the affected creature cannot benefit from long rests, and therefore gains a point of exhaustion at the beginning of the next day. The poison leaves the creature's system 24 hours after ingestion.

#### Nordra

Biome: Deserts

An aloe-like cactus that, when cut, releases a sticky yellow sap that smells like urine. This sap can then be applied to wounds, healing for 1 hit point and stopping up further bleeding.

#### Northlinch

Biome: Cities

A commonly cultivated strain of pipeweed known for its inferior quality and harsh flavor. It has no beneficial effects, and too much use of the weed over the years has been linked to a younger death.

#### Nossa

Biome: Plains

Nossa is a plain looking wild-flower resembling a perfectly white tiger lily, with various shades of white representing the plants natural pigmentation. While Nossa itself is not uncommon, the process to make it useable for its primary purposes is incredibly long, tedious, and expensive. Requiring preparation by a talented spellcaster, Nossa can be turned into an incredibly expensive poison, called Zealot’s Blade, by combining the ground petals of the flower with liquid gold and exposing the resulting mixture to the light from the spell Sunburst once a day for a week. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 15d12 radiant/poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage ignores resistances and immunities. To purchase, Zealot’s Blade typically goes for upwards of 10,000 gold pieces for a single vial containing only a very small amount of the poison which can then be applied to a weapon only once.

#### Novanor

Biome: Deserts

Commonly found in many desert areas, Novanor is the fruit of a cactus of the same name, growing in small orange pustules along the cactus’s underside. These fruits can be eaten as emergency water reserves in the middle of the desert, but also serve a darker, more dangerous purpose. Harvesting the fruit, drying them in the sun, and then soaking the dried fruit in the blood of a Lamia (those poor, misunderstood creatures) will create a sticky, scarlet paste called Blood Fire. After injury with a weapon coated with Blood Fire, the blood begins to rapidly oxygenate, essentially burning the target from the inside out, and sometimes leaving little more than a charred skeleton behind. The victim must make a DC 12 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the target will take 1d6+1 fire damage per round for the next 10 minutes or until cured. On a successful save, the target only takes 1d6+1 additional fire damage on the first hit. O
