#### Pallast

Biome: Forests, Jungles, and Swamps

Pallast is a willow-tree relative that grows up to about 30 feet tall in many temperate and tropical environments. When ground together with marshmallow root and imbibed, Pallast cures minor aches and pains, especially headaches and pain from abscessed teeth, sore muscles, and so forth. Pallast by itself can be turned into a very bitter pale powder, and is usually served in a heavily sweetened tea. (Relieves minor pains but does not restore lost hit points.)

#### Panaeolo

Biome: Rivers

Magical herb whose leaves tastes like leather and function as an ingested drug with no initial effect. Secondary effect after 1d4 hours is to increase all arcane spell save DCs by 2 for 1d4 hours and 1d8 psychic damage. A second dose within an hour of the first improves the effect to a +3 to save DCs and deals 2d8 psychic damage. Further doses only cause more and increasing psychic damage.

#### Pattran

Biome: Plains

The root of a small, shrub-like plant with dark green, shiny leaves and thorns, Pattran is used to relax the muscles and encourage sleep. In mild dosages, Pattran causes a general feeling of relaxation, eases sore, strained or sprained muscles, and similar aches. In larger doses, Pattran causes sleepiness. Pattran tastes like a combination of mint and rich soil. (For sleep dosages, user may voluntarily choose to sleep well or, if resisting, make a DC 12 Constitution Save. Effects last 2d4 hours; if asleep, the user will sleep and awaken normally.)

#### Pennyroyal

Biome: Forests and Rivers

Pennyroyal is a low creeping herb with a squarish stem and small dark green leaves which grow in pairs. The flowers grow in round clusters which are mauve in hue. The leaves should be plucked and thrown into a person’s bath water while still fresh. They may then have an aphrodisiac effect on anyone the recipient attempts to influence in the next 1d4 days (+1 to persuasion checks made within that period). In addition, if dried, the leaves may be sprinkled among books, and will then act as an insect repellent. These make the leaves highly prized among mages and sages who will normally pay between 12 and 15 gp for small amounts of the dried leaves.

#### Peony

Biome: Plains and Cities

This plant with its delicate pink flowers may be boiled into a powerful healing draught, capable of stopping all bleeding, internal and external, immediately and healing for 1d8 hit points. However, a roll of 1 on the nature check by the herbalist, will kill the recipient in 1d4 minutes, as they suffer a massive heart attack. The herb can also be deliberately used as a poison by using five times the normal dosage.

#### Petiveria

Biome: Plains

This plant has a single stem with dark green, shiny leaves growing from it. It is topped by very thin, yellow flowers. The petals of these flowers should be mixed into a poultice, where they will, on a successful application, act to bring down swelling and the discoloration from bruising over the course of a one-day period. Commonly used across the realm as a cold compress for blackeyes. 

^petiveria

#### Phandar

Biome: Forests

A knobby deciduous tree with mottled bark, the branches often grow away from the prevailing wind, often giving a copse of the trees the appearance of being almost blown over by strong winds. The branches support a surprising amount of small triangular leaves, and are the natural home for a species of moth that resemble the leaves. The strength of the wood lends itself to be an excellent choice for tool handles, bows, and small boats. The mul- ticolored grains are regularly in fashion for jewelry making in such places as Waterdeep and Suzail. However, because of excessive logging over several centuries, the tree can only be found in isolated copses, often far from centers of civilization.

#### Pixie Table

Biome: Forests

Rare 1-foot tall and 1-foot diameter mushroom with a dark lavender cap that can be found in any woodland but is most common in temperate forests housing Fey. If boiled with cloth, the resulting fabric is dyed Lavender. It is the main ingredient for a red liquid called Memorybind, which allows a prepared caster to prepare an extra 1st level spell in exchange for reducing all save DCs by 2 until the next long rest.

#### Poison Apple

Biome: Jungles

A magically bred medium-sized apple tree that bears red fruits that taste good but function as a strong sleeping poison (DC 18 Constitution Save or the recipient falls into a deep magical sleep for 2d6 days). The sleep can be cured by a Protection from Poison spell. 

^poison-apple

#### Pomow

Biome: Plains

A magically created dark-purple spheroid fruit-plant that grows to 1-2 feet across, serves as a hardy crop viable in a range of climates. Meat, root and seeds are edible and high in protein, core of the plant is filled with juice, the fibers are similar to cotton, and the rind can be used as a sharpening strap for fine blades. A new fruit starts growing as soon as the old one is plucked, taking 2 weeks to grow to maturity.

#### Pondstone Tree

Biome: Jungles and Swamps

A towering willow relative that grows in tropical and near-tropical swamps, pondstone wood is often used for its flexibility while freshly cut to construct simple boats and canoes. In addition, the reduction of the wood over a low flame will cause a collection of sap on the ends of the wood. This sap can then be collected, further distilled, and consumed as a tincture that induces mild hallucinogenic effects, including the capability to see one’s own body from a third person point of view. It is argued among enthusiasts about whether you truly do see yourself in third person or whether the hallucinations are just a reconstruction of your surroundings using artificially heightened senses. There are no known negative side effects to pondstone sap consumption, and the recreational use of pondstone sap is referred to as Sap Goggling.

#### Poznan’s Chain

Biome: Jungles and Mountains

Poznan's Chain is a soft-wooded clinging vine armed with white, pearlescent spines, 2" to 3" in length that alternate the entire length of the vine with leathery leaves. These vines are typically only found growing on sheer cliff faces or the most opulent ruined buildings. While a single chain will usually run for 20' to 50' and spread to cover an area of about 200 square feet, some vines are purported to reach 100' or more and cover thousands of square feet with their leaves and thorns. The thorns of Poznan's Chain secrete a virulent poison that causes internal organs to violently rupture and hemorrhage (DC 18 Cons. Save. On a failed save take 6d8 poison damage and the poisoned effect for 6 hours, and on a successful save take half as much damage with no secondary effect.), leading to a bloody death in as little as 20 to 30 seconds. Curiously, if this poison is collected and taken more than 5' from the vine it immediately becomes water. Some claim that Poznan's Chain can produce large, silvery, metallic, star-shaped blooms, but these reports have never been verified.

#### Prickly Tea

Biome: Jungles

#### Prince’s Feather

This herb has red-green leaves and long pink flowers. The flowers must be ground into powder and eaten by the recipient. If successful, the herb will halve the rate of internal bleeding within 1 turn, decreasing the damage taken in the next turn by half.

#### Psyllium (Plantain Weed)

Biome: Cities and Plains

A very common weed in both cities and plains alike, Psyllium is a broad-leafed ground plant with a central stalk that buds small green seeds. Psyllium is a useful plant that is commonly used to treat constipation, scurvy, and to aid in weight-loss. Aside from its common uses, Plantain Weed is one of the weeds and herbs mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease. 

^psyllium-plantain-weed

#### Purple Pipeweed

Biome: Plains and Cities

A short, purple weed that was originally a farm-field pest before it started being farmed itself can be dried and smoked, and is in fact very commonly smoked by spellcasters that focus on illusory magic. For one hours after smoking a quantity of pipeweed, the consumer is elevated to a higher state of imagination. This unfortunately gives them an increased chance of being surprised (enemies in combat will always will a surprise round against the pipeweed smoker while he or she is under its effects) but also increases the spell save DC of any illusion magic cast by the pipeweed user by +2.

#### Pygmy King Flower

Biome: Jungles and Swamps

The Pygmy King Flower produces a conical, flower-like structure from a base of 8-10 fat, fluid filled leaves that resemble a broken rib cage. The flower is usually 1' in diameter, 2' tall, and always brightly colored. While the color can vary greatly, solid orange and blue with yellow spots are the most common colors in tropical locales. Nectar fills at least half of each basin shaped flower and when exposed to sunlight this liquid releases a sweet, sugary fragrance. Small creatures and large insects are attracted to this smell but upon entering the flower they are trapped by its slippery walls and slowly digested. When a Pygmy King Flower finishes digesting a meal, or becomes over filled (such as after a heavy rain) the flower will tilt and dump its contents onto the jungle floor before slowly righting itself once more. The succulent, rib shaped leaves at the base of this plant can be mashed into a salve that is an excellent treatment for major burns and minor lacerations (successful application of this salve can cure up to 2d8 fire damage if applied within 3 rounds of taking that damage).
