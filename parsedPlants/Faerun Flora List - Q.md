#### Queen’s Ambrosia

Biome: Plains

A low, waxy-leafed shrub plant with large yellow flowers pointed upward. These flowers collect water and the flowers’ natural nectar and pollen then sweeten the water and add some essence that makes the liquid inside slightly intoxicating. A common tradition in some parts of the realm is to have a picnic the day after a rainstorm next to a Queen’s Ambrosia bush so that the flowers may serve as refreshment for the old and for the young to sneak sips from.

#### Quickweed

Biome: Coastal

Quickweed grows as a series of short, flat, silvery leaf blades along a single root runner, and is so named because it completes its entire life cycle in a single week. A living/growing end and a decaying/dying end is clearly visible on each root runner, and with patient observation it is possible to watch the root grow and die in real time. The grass always grows in a single direction along its root causing entire fields of Quickweed to appear to migrate around islands, like a wave, as time goes by. Alchemists prize Quickweed as it acts as an additive that amplifies the benefits of concoctions related to time, speed, and travel.

#### Quivar

Biome: Arctic
