#### Rainbowpetal

Biome: Jungles

Rainbowpetal grows as a stout, relatively straight stem with triangular green leaves, and reaches a height of 4' to 8'. Many fourpetaled flowers appear at the top of this stem forming a terminal spike of 12" to 16". The flowers of the Rainbowpetal can appear as any color and individual petals will even grow in distinct colors on the same flower. The petals of these flowers are thick, fleshy, and surprisingly nutritious. They are frequently boiled into a thick and flavorful porridge or dried and used in place of bread crumbs or cornmeal on fried food. If eaten raw, a single spike of Rainbowpetal flowers can sustain a normal sized human for a full day.

#### Ratavasa Flowers

Biome: Jungles

A short purple flower that grows close to the ground, the plant is generally little more than a few floppy leaves sitting above the soil. However, during the warmer months, the plant sprouts a cluster of small purple flowers that smell faintly of cinnamon. The petals of the flower are often steeped in hot water to create a tea that prevents conception. Any female drinking the tea is unable to become pregnant within the next two days. 

^ratavasa-flowers

#### Rattlestalks

Biome: Jungles and Swamps

These tall stalks that grow out of stagnant water end in a thick bulb with a hard shell. In the warmer months, the stalk withers, and the bulb falls off, to float around until the bulb softens and falls away to disperse the seeds within. The seeds sit freely in the shell, and when shaken make a slight rattling noise, which is unnerving when the wind rushes through a cluster of rattlestalks. Tribes that live in the swamps will often use the unnerving aspect of the rattlestalks to create fear inducing noisemakers that are then added to spears and other weapons. When rattled, those that have no knowledge of the rattlestalks must make a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw, or be Frightened for 1d4 minutes. 

^rattlestalks

#### Razorvine

Biome: Plains

A climbing, running vine native to the open plain-lands that is nigh impossible to get rid of as it grows at least 1 ft per day even if cut down to a stub. Dried Razorvine provides excellent fire kindle. Light contact without the use of protective gear deals 1d6 points of damage, while e.g. falling into it deals up to 3d6 points of damage; but this damage is reduced by a creature’s natural armor bonus.

#### Reath

Biome: Jungles

Parasitic vine that grows on many types of jungle tree, whose leaves when used as a component for a plant or plant-creature targeting spell has a 50% chance of increasing the DC by 2. 

^reath

#### Redflower

Biome: Swamps

Tiny red-bog flower that can be made into a crushed leaf drug, no initial effect, secondary effect for 10 minutes that grants the ability to use an action to gain +4 on the roll to attack a single creature. Overdose if second dose taken during duration causes 1d4 x 10 minutes nauseated.

#### Redgold’s Feather

Biome: Plains and Mountains

Redgold's Feather grows as small, tight cluster of burnished, copper-colored, feather-shaped fronds near areas of thermal activity. The plant is impervious to heat, and some claim to have even seen it undergo instantaneous growth when exposed to direct flame. If the leaves of this plant are broken or crushed they give off an acerbic odor potent enough to wake a person from unconsciousness (even magical) or immediately recover from being dazed or disoriented. If the feathers are crushed and combined with sulfur and the essence of a naturally fiery creature, an alchemist can create a non-toxic liquid that will glow a bright orange for 36-48 hours (even after being consumed and digested).

#### Redroot

Biome: Plains and Cities

Redroot is a tangled mass of leafy shoots that grows close to the ground. While it does grow wild in a large swath of the Realms, it is also sometimes intentionally planted on farms. Pulling a ripened root from the ground reveals a large crimson colored tuber. The tuber is often turned into a curative paste which can be applied to wounds to soothe the pain and speed healing (+5 to any hit dice expended during a short rest). While helpful for healing, ingesting the root often causes nausea and vomiting (DC 16 Constitution Save to avoid vomiting and nausea for the next 1d4 hours).

#### Redstar Flowers

Biome: Mountains

A strange plant with a translucent pink stem, numerous small branches fork off of the main stem, each of them ending in a small red flower with five petals. Each flower has a small opening which leads down the branch to a small pool of sap. The sap has a sickeningly sweet aroma which draws in small insects, which then become disoriented and perish in the sap and are dissolved. The plant is often harvested for the sweet sap, which is sifted to remove the remains of insects. Next the sap is heated, and used to coat confections and pastries, which then hardens to become a glaze. Bakers in small cities will pay a large price for the raw sap.

#### Rewk

Biome: Plains

The nodules of the stem of Rewk must be brewed in clear water for one whole day before drinking. It will then cure 1d8 points of damage.

#### Ribwort Plantain

Biome: Jungles

This plant has a cluster of dark green leaves, with marked parallel veins at its base, a single stem topped by a cluster of tiny, pale orange flowers. The chopped leaves are applied to the flesh to reduce bruising. A successful application will remove slight bruises altogether within an hour, more severe bruises will take up to 8 hours.

#### Ripplebark

Biome: Forests

Shelf-like fungus that looks like rotting flesh but is perfectly edible, although it tastes better if cooked properly. Restores 1d4+1 hit points if eaten raw and 2d4+2 hit points if properly prepared. 

^ripplebark

#### Ripplewood

Biome: Jungles and Underdark/Caves

Dark-green vine up to 400 ft long with no roots or leaves, native to the elemental planes of air but transplanted to the material plane. Ripplewood vines form massive twisted nests of at least 4 vines that grow upward from the top to hang from a cave ceiling or large tree. Often used by giant eagles and such to make nests. A cluster of vines can support 500 lb per 5 sq.ft. 

^ripplewood

#### Rosecork

Biome: Forests

A short tree that sprouts many thick, diverging branches and a plentiful amount of small ovular leaves. The bark is a light shade of red, and darkens during winter months. Due to the considerable amount of moisture that the trees retain, it is seen as a poor choice for burning. Rosecork wood will often take several hours of exposure to flame for enough water to evaporate to the point where the wood burns. It is for this reason that it is occasionally used in construction in areas surrounding volcanoes or in the construction of war-boats and battleships.

#### Rose Campion

Biome: Deserts

Consuming this green-brown herb will protect against scorpion and spider stings for a period of three days, granting advantage on Constitution Saving throws against poison from arachnids. 

^rose-campion

#### Rose of Forgetfulness

Biome: Plains, Jungles and Forests

This unusual rose, often identified by the multicolored petals, are only found rarely in the wild, as their scent causes lingering problems. Their tangled vines are covered in sharp red thorns, and the smooth green leaves are tinged in orange. Those that smell the mesmerizing fragrance of the roses must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or forget the past 2d4 minutes. Failing the saving throw by 5 or more causes the victim to forget the past 1d6 hours, and a spellcaster to forget 1d6 spells occupying the highest spell slots first. Those that fail the saving throw by 10 or more forget the past 1d6 days, and spellcasters forget 2d6 spells occupying the highest spell slots first. Rolling a 1 on the saving throw causes the inhaler to suffer from complete amnesia, and can only be cured by a Wish, Greater Restoration, or 8th level Heal spell to restore their forgotten identity. 

^rose-of-forgetfulness

#### Rouddan

Biome: Arctic

A root vegetable, the leaves of the Rouddan are broad and soft. Known as the “red turnip of Fallingard” it is a staple food of nearby peasants. Due to necessity, a large variety of different methods of preparation have arisen, including a thick stew of Rouddan, and as a base for slop mashes. The root keeps well when kept in a cool and dry climate, and resists decomposition well. While they can be eaten raw, they are best soaked in broth or spiced water (heals for 1d4 hit points if eaten raw or 1d8 hit points if eaten in soup; the creation of soup can also split a single Rouddan into 8 servings). 

^rouddan

#### Rowan Tree

Biome: Forests

A small, deciduous tree that sprouts small bunches of white berries that quickly turn to red-orange in summer months. The tree, according to common folklore, is supposed to protect from evil spirits and bad luck, and planting one on your property used to be a common tradition. The berries can be eaten, but taste relatively foul and cause a slight diuretic effect. Use of Rowan wood is well documented in wand and staff making, and is supposed to yield slightly better results when used to cast spells in the fields of Abjuration and Divination.

#### Ruby Apple

Biome: Forests

A legendary tree allegedly created by a by a female elf, most gifted in the cultivation of magically grown plants, in her final moments of life. It’s an apple tree that grows rubies instead of apples. Similar trees used to grow in the orchard at Lentari Farms prior to the area’s destruction. The trees are scattered around far-removed areas of forest and if one is stumbled across, the tree can be harvested for 2d4 fist sized rubies that each sell for 300 gp. 

^ruby-apple

#### Ruby Blushrose

Biome: Jungles and Plains

The long stems of the rose are oddly free of thorns that grace other similar flowers, while the rose itself is abundant among the plant’s setms, large, and red. The rose tends to grow in clumps with others of the same species. Smelling the rose has a curious effect, as the pleasing aroma causes people to blush. Extended exposure to the aroma causes exhaustion and light-headedness. Those that spend more than a few moments within 10 feet of a blushrose must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer Disadvantage on Constitution and Wisdom saving throws for as long as they remain within proximity and 2d6 minutes afterward. Some romantics declare that the blushrose brings the euphoric and lightheaded feelings of being in love to the forefront. 

^ruby-blushrose

#### Rue

Biome: Plains

Rue is a small rounded bush which grows to about three feet in height. It has yellow, scoop-like flowers. The leaves are shaped like spades, and are blue-grey in color. It has seedpods which resemble a small lime. The seedpods should be consumed as an antidote to ingested poisons. Provided it is taken within 10 minutes of the poison being ingested, it will neutralize the poison effect in 1d4 minutes, on a successful nature check. S
