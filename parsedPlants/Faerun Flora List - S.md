#### Sabito

Biome: Coastal

This shrub plant is found growing in the sands of coastal dunes and has leaves which are bluish in tinge. The root is dark blue in color and small, pill-like growths sprout from these roots. Consuming one of these growths will allow the recipient to breathe underwater for 10 minutes, by allowing them to absorb the oxygen in the water directly into their skin through osmosis. Their skin has a translucent appearance for these ten minutes. This process also works above water, but not as effectively, making it uncomfortable to do much of anything for the time spent above the surface. 

^sabito

#### Sable Fir

Biome: Forests

A hardy tree that spreads runners from one original “mother” tree, sometimes creating entire forests from one tree. The Sable Fir allegedly makes for excellent arrow-shafts and turns a deep lustrous black if lumbered mid-winter and rubbed with hot oils, making for beautiful and valuable bows and staves. 

^sable-fir

#### Sadaq’s Bedwort

Biome: Plains and Rivers

Long regarded as a plant sacred to Druids and Rangers of Sadaq, Sadaq’s Bedwort is a low-growing ground cover plant found in beds near flooded plain areas and rivers. Preparation of the bedwort in sacramental wine under the light of the new moon will allow for the creation of a concoction called Sadaq’s Empathy. This concoction will allow the recipient to converse with plants and animals in the native tongue for a period of up to 12 hours after consumption. In addition, the recipient will also have lowered spell component costs for spells involving nature and plant growth, or that target plants and animals. Harvesting too much of a bed at the same time will cause the bed to begin to rot as the bed is actually a single organism that spreads deep into the earth. 

^sadaqs-bedwort

#### Saddilia

Biome: Jungles

This rare tree can grow up to 60 feet tall and can survive to quite old ages. It has dark red wood, and equally dark blue leaves. The flowers, which grow in small bunches, are startling white, almost radiant. Its nuts have a very special property; each nut raises the Intelligence or Wisdom (determine randomly) of the eater by 0.1 point (20 nuts or 2 full points max). The effect lasts for a whole week, after which it fades again, although there is a 1% chance the effect is permanent. Around the tree there are often animals (squirrels, salmon) who eat the nuts on a regular basis, and are therefore quite intelligent, often possessing speech or even (DM’s discretion) spellcasting abilities. The number of nuts available varies greatly, depending on the age of the tree, the number of creatures aware of its existence, but mainly, of course, on the DM’s wishes. 

^saddilia

#### Saffron

Biome: Plains

The plant has a tuberous root, and large purplish flowers with yellow-red centers. The pistils of the flower must be pulped into a paste which is then left to dry for a week. The resulting powder is taken as snuff. This herb raises all attribute scores by one for one hour. After consumption the first time, the user must make a DC 18 Constitution Save or become addicted. After the initial hour of stat raises, stats will lower from the base value by 1 every day until the next consumption. 

^saffron

#### Salamander Orchids

Biome: Arctic and Cities

Orchid that's constantly on fire, propagated by a talented spellcaster from the City of Brass. Allows any non-trained craftsman to turn a weapon into a flaming weapon with the appropriate nature check. Handling the orchid without proper tools deals 1d6 points of fire damage per minute. 

^salamander-orchids

#### Sand Vine

Biome: Coastal and Oceans

Relatively rare rope-like seaweed found along temperate or warmer coasts. Grows both above and below water, commonly rooted to a small rock. Can be dried and used as rope. With alchemy, its juices can be made into Vine Oil, which is a topical anaesthetic granting a creature +5 temporary hit points. Lasts for 1 hour or until hit points are drained, has the side-effect that within 24 hours of use, a creature cannot stabilize on its own (so even with successful death saves, the creature or person must be assisted). Regular use gives a signature salt and slight rotten fish smell. 

^sand-vine

#### Sandberry Bush

Biome: Deserts

Small bushes with waxy green leaves, Sandberry Bush grows in the remote reaches of the Shaar. The bush has small yellow berries that have a bitter taste, but can be brewed to make a soothing tea. The few nomadic tribes that pass through the Shaar pick the berries as a remedy for insomnia. Acts as a sleep aid, so if the consumer is willing, induces a 6-hour sleep cycle with no negative side-effects. 

^sandberry-bush

#### Sanicle

Biome: Plains and Forests

A small, mildly invasive plant with almost star-shaped leaves and small, white or pink bell-shaped flowers atop a slender, offshooting stalk. Sanicle leaves should be crushed and left in white wine, the strained through a cloth and drunk. The resulting concoction, when consumed, has the effect of binding wounds so that they are not reopened by action. (+2 to rolls made with hit dice expended during a short rest.) 

^sanicle

#### Saracen’s Confound

Biome: Plains

This herb cures fevers within 1d4-1 hours. 

^saracens-confound

#### Sarasar

Biome: Mountains

A short, woody bush with very few leaves, commonly found near gullies and ravines, so the plants can collect as much water as possible. When the wood is burnt, it creates a long-lasting thick fog that will consistently stay in place for about as long as it is burning and then begins to fade, disappearing completely in one hour. The smoke fills a cubic volume of 10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft. 

^sarasar

#### Sasami Tree

Biome: Jungles and Cities

This dwarf tree is favored among nobility of the southern provinces, as it is easy to cultivate and grows quickly. The sparse leaves it produces are diamond shaped and light green with a tinge of pink on the edges. The exercise in restraint is one lesson that the Sasami Tree teaches children of the wealthy patience and restraint. Cutting off too many branches causes the tree to sicken and perish, while allowing the tree to grow wild often causes the tree to turn into an unruly mess. The leaves are often exchanged as a decorative gift between servants and their far-off relatives. 

^sasami-tree

#### Scarlet Heart Mushrooms

Biome: Forests and Swamps

Large black mushrooms covered in heart-shaped red spots, those trekking through swamps may encounter this dangerous and obnoxious fungus. When a living creature comes within 5 feet of the fungus, the red spots are capable of detecting heat and will release a noxious cloud of spores within the same radius. Anyone within the affected area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 2d4 hours. 

^scarlet-heart-mushrooms

#### Scented Mayweed

Biome: Arctic

Scented mayweed grows to a height of about 2 feet. It has upright and branching stems, small leaves, and white flowers with a yellow center. The flowers must be crushed, emitting a pungent odor if prepared correctly, and should then be applied to the eyes in order to heal damage to them caused by acid or poison. If used within a day of the injury, they can prevent blindness. Aside from its common uses, Scented Mayweed is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease. 

^scented-mayweed

#### Scholar’s Dream

Biome: Plains and Cities

Ivy that grows on the graves of sages and wise-men. If used as a component for abjuration domain spells it doubles range and duration. 

^scholars-dream

#### Serapia’s Turbith

Biome: Mountains

This herb will place the recipient into a deep sleep for 24 full hours. The recipient cannot be woken even by magical means. At the end of the day, all wounds will be healed and hit points regained. It does not, of course, resurrect a dead person, but the plant’s magically induced coma will in fact regenerate lost limbs. 

^serapias-turbith

#### Seregon

Biome: Mountains

Coin-sized blood-red flowers that bloom directly from their roots in rocky soil. Ingesting the flower’s nectar grants the creature 2d6 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour or until expended. This effect cannot be combined with any other effect that grants temporary hit points. 

^seregon

#### Serpent Sweat

Biome: Underdark/Caves

The fungus appears to be a cluster of small yellow beads, often growing on decomposing matter. Small black stems hold them aloft, and their surface is shiny enough to reflect torchlight. While the fungus may appear like berries, they are quite poisonous. Underdark denizens will often collect the fungus wearing leather gloves to prevent touching it with their skin. When the fungi are touched with bare hands must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be Paralyzed for 1d4 hours and begin to sweat profusely. Those that fail the saving throw by 5 or more suffer 24 (8d6) poison damage. 

^serpent-sweat

#### Serren Wood

Biome: Jungles

Tall, hardy trees transplanted from Arborea's top layer of Arvandor, and a vessel for nature spirits. Bows, Arrows, or Crossbow bolts made from this wood add 1d4+1 radiant damage to any successful attack. Exceptionally difficult to craft with. 

^serren-wood

#### Sessali

Biome: Coastal

A rugged, thorny plant found by the sea. The leaves must be boiled for two hours in salt water, and the resultant mix sweetened with honey. This mixture will act as a cure for certain types of longterm, typically incurable ingested poisons or wasting diseases (DM’s discretion, as to which ones). The recipient must be made to drink one dose immediately when the mixture is ready, and then further doses every twelve hours for three days (7 doses in all). If the number of successful applications is four or more, the patient will recover. 

^sessali

#### Sezarad

Biome: Plains

Broad vivid flower with a short brittle root which, when chewed, functions as a stimulatory drug. The initial effect is 1d8 temporary hit points and an additional 1d8 hit points after two full minutes of chewing that stack with each other and last for 10 minutes after initial ingestion or until used up. -1 to Wisdom checks for 20 minutes after ingestion. 

^sezarad

#### Shadbush

Biome: Forests and Jungles

A red, waxy-leafed bush that produces small, burgundy colored berries that can be eaten in small amounts to ward off scurvy and nutrition-related illness. 

^shadbush

#### Shadowrose

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A perfectly black rose bush, with black roots, stems, leaves, and buds, that grows only in deep caves and wilts in the presence of any light, magic or non-magic, brighter than a candle. When the petals of this rose are consumed, it will grant a regeneration rate of 3 hit points per round for 2d10 rounds. After that, the recipient will be unable to perform any action, including movement, for 2 rounds. 

^shadowrose

#### Shadowtop

Biome: Forests

A rather tall and fast-growing tree that can be found throughout Faerun. The leaves only grow at the very top of the tree and appear dark green from above and have a copper hue from beneath. These leaves are also highly flammable, and are often gathered to be used as tinder. The wood of the tree is quite fibrous, but not dense enough to be worthwhile building material. Instead the strands are often broken down and woven into thick rope. The wood burns fairly hot and long and without an abundance of smoke, thus making it ideal for use in hearth fires and torches. 

^shadowtop

#### Shaggy Ink Mushrooms

Biome: Swamps and Underdark/Caves

A small, button mushroom that can be milked to harvest a shiny black liquid. This liquid, if consumed or absorbed through the skin, will cause the recipient to mope about vocally, and loudly question their choices in life. Affected creatures just want to lean against the wall and cry. A save is allowed for every instance they are slapped by another person, DC 16 Wisdom Save, with a cumulative -1 to the DC per slap. 

^shaggy-ink-mushrooms

#### Shepherd’s Purse

Biome: Mountains

This herb rarely grows to a height of more than 18 inches. It has small greyish green leaves, growing smaller towards the summit of the plant. It has small four petalled cream-white flowers at its peak. If applied as a compress within 4 turns of taking poison damage, it will undo up to 3d4 of that damage. 

^shepherds-purse

#### Silver Hibiscus

Biome: Jungles and Underdark/Caves

This silver-grey plant looks as though it represents madness itself. It often has random patterns and unplanned shapes, but always has a black web-like pattern on it. If touched bare-handed, the target must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save or take 2d6 Psychic damage. When prepared correctly, the leaf can take on the special qualities of the elements and grant a talentaed herbalist 3 uses of an elemental breath weapon, randomly chosen from Lightning, Poison, Fire, or Acid. 

^silver-hibiscus

#### Silver Tassel Toadstool

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Growing deep within damp caves, Silver Tassel Toadstool is a slightly fluorescent shelf toadstool that has small structures resembling tassels hanging from its edge. These tassels are actually the fungi’s reproductive organs, and the spores from these structures can be harvested and mixed with oil to create an ingested poison called Pale Tincture. This milky liquid is the primary choice of cruel manipulators that often use it to coerce favors out of unwilling acquaintances. The poison is introduced unknowingly, and slowly chips away at the victim's vitality, always threatening a slow and painful death. The promise of a cure is enough to make most people do things that they would otherwise avoid. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw vs poison or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 8 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally, and only a greater restoration spell can end this poison outside of the cure or making the successful saving throws. The cure can be made by harvesting the toadstool’s spores and combining these with alcohol that is then exposed to at least 15 points of radiant damage, which is enough to mutate the poisonous compounds in the spores. 

^silver-tassel-toadstool

#### Silverleaf

Biome: Mountains and Plains

Only blooming by the light of a full moon, the plant appears to be largely nondescript until seen at night in full bloom. The entire plant is basked in a silvery glow, and the flower is large and luminescent white. At the end of the night the flower falls off of the plant and quickly wilts in the morning sun. However, before the flower wilts, it can be ground into a fine powder, the mere smell of which repels lycanthropes, who take a -8 penalty to initiative when in the presence of the fresh flower. 

^silverleaf

#### Silverthorn (Aelebera)

Biome: Mountains

Silverthorn is a small thorny plant, white in color with red berries and silver thorns. This herb can function either as a poison or as an antidote to itself. It is found only by one specific lake located high in the mountains. For use as a poison the thorns must be crushed and boiled in oil over the course of a night, at which point, the resultant mixture may be smeared on the end of a weapon. When the weapon pierces its target, the poison will take effect killing the victim within 2d6 hours. There is no save and no cure, except for the antidote outlined below. Not even the most powerful magic can cure this poison. The only cure for this poison is also made from the Silverthorn plant. The berries must be boiled in absolutely pure water, prepared in a pure silver vessel, and the resultant mixture stored in an adamantine vial until use. The liquid must be placed on the dying victims lips, where within 1d20 minutes, they will recover from the poisoning. 

^silverthorn-aelebera

#### Silverwood

Biome: Forests

A type of tree nurtured by sylvan elves to grow into unique forms, be free of disease and produce delicious sap that is made into the famous Elven Silvermead. The sap is clear and slightly sticky, and provides a +2 bonus on Constitution saves VS poison for 1 hour. 

^silverwood

#### Sinquoi

Biome: Deserts

The red leaves of this unusually twisted tree should be burned, and the smoke inhaled. This will have the effect of ‘dilating’ time (making it appear to pass slower.) For every minute experienced outside the influence of the herb, only thirty seconds will actually pass. A single dose is effective for 1d6 hours. Normally used by torturers to prolong agony, the leaves may also be used by people who must think quickly. It does not increase the speed at which a person moves but you may be able to see an opponent telegraph their movements more easily. (DC 20 Dexterity Save when a melee attack is targeted toward you, on a successful save, your AC increases by 2 for the period of that attack.) However, Sinquoi also causes side-effects in the form of halved movement speed for 1d6 hours after the initial dosage wears off. 

^sinquoi

#### Sky Lotus

Biome: Mountains

White, stemless flower native to high altitudes that can be found floating lazily through the air between 4 and 15 feet off the ground. Provides 1 day of nutrition if eaten but contains trace amounts of arsenic that can affect creatures that eat a lot of them (DC 5 Constitution save that increases by 1 on each consecutive flower eaten, 2d8 poison damage on a failed save). If oil is collected from 10 sky lotuses, it produces a natural potion of levitation that is also a full dose of poison (DC 15 Constitution save, 2d12 poison damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful save). 

^sky-lotus

#### Sleeping Ivy

Biome: Plains and Coastal

This woody, vine with golden, spade shaped leaves growing in fan shaped clusters of three or five is a true climber, often reaching 30' to 40'. The blooms of Sleeping Ivy are blue-violet colored tufts, or puffballs, which become covered in an extremely fine yellowish powder. A rash of tiny, fluid filled blisters will form on any skin that has come in contact 1-4 hours after initial contact. Despite its "angry" appearance, the inflamed area is not painful and does not itch, but instead will tingle numbly. After becoming exposed to Sleeping Ivy a victim will become more lethargic and harder to wake from sleep. At first the lethargy brought on by exposure may be so slight as to be unnoticeable, but it will increase in intensity each day it goes untreated. On the seventh day of untreated exposure the victim will fall asleep (quite peacefully) and never wake again. To treat Sleeping Ivy, the inflamed area must be bathed in alcohol. The higher the proof, the more rapid the recovery. 

^sleeping-ivy

#### Sleepweed

Biome: Plains

This plant appears similar to milkweed, and its pods contain sleepinducing spores. Pods can be thrown as a ranged attack (range 5- ft) and a struck target must make a DC 15 Constitution save or fall asleep for 1 minute. 

^sleepweed

#### Slimmerane

Biome: Jungles, Plains, and Mountains

A tropical, creeping ground vine that has small serrated leaves resembling the leaves of blackberry bushes. Instead of producing blackberries, however, this vine produces small pink berries that can be mashed into a pulp and consumed. Although exceedingly sour, this mixture will grant advantage on the saving throw for the next spell that is cast upon you. Lasts until this spell is cast or 24 hours if no such spell is cast. 

^slimmerane

#### Slumberweed

Biome: Plains

Dried and powdered leaves of this blue-green fuzzy plant, if consumed, can cause a sleeplike state that resembles death for 8 hours (Constitution Save DC 13 negates). Can also be turned into a poultice and delivered via blowgun (no Constitution save required to place the victim into sleep if delivered this way). 

^slumberweed

#### Snakespike

Biome: Plains

A thin stalk covered with yellow-green flowers. The leaves can be steeped in water to make a tea that, when imbibed 3 times a day, reduces inflammation and restores strength; when made into an ointment, snakespike soothes and promotes rapid healing. (Tea gives 1d4 temporary hit points/day; ointment restores 1 hit point immediately per application but can only be administered to the same character once per short rest.) 

^snakespike

#### Snapping Grass

Biome: Plains

Snapping Grass grows as a clump, or tuft of dark green, dagger shaped leaves, 4" to 6" tall. Six to twelve stalks, each 8" to 10" high grow from the center of this cluster. A pair of hinged, shovel shaped, bright fuchsia leaves, rimmed in spikes sit at the top of each stalk. These stalks sway constantly, as if moved by a gentle breeze. It is unclear how exactly Snapping Grass hunts, but the moving stalks are able to bend, lunge and snap up small creatures with exceptional accuracy. While this plant subsists almost entirely on a diet of small vermin and birds, some adventurers have reported that some clumps of Snapping Grass will lunge and attempt to eat small, shiny or sparkling objects like rings and gems. 

^snapping-grass

#### Snowflake Lichen

Biome: Arctic

Magical plant that looks like snow and grows on rocks in cold climates; it leeches heat from any and and all sources. Within 10 feet of the lichen, the temperature grows noticeably colder. Within 5 feet, the creature must make a DC 12 Constitution save, taking 2d6 cold damage on a failed save. Touching, even with protective gloves or armor, causes 2d12 cold damage on a failed DC 15 Constitution save. 

^snowflake-lichen

#### Snowwood

Biome: Arctic

A pale tree with a slightly bluish cast to the mottled bark, growing predominantly in the far north. The trunks of the trees are often thin and dense, with spindly limbs and dark green leaves. The mottled coloration of the bark often forms into shapes that vaguely resemble faces, and a few tribes hold a belief that the trees hold the spirits of ancestors that watch over and protect them. The trees are quite remarkable as they can survive in some of the coldest climates, and have even been seen as far north as the High Ice and the Reghed Glacier. The roots of the tree often stretch deep, anchoring the tree in places where other vegetation would find difficult purchase. 

^snowwood

#### Soarwood

Biome: Jungles

Rare wood native to Aerenal that possesses magical buoyancy. Water-vessels made from Soarwood cost quadruple price to construct, but move at double speed and are more reliable in rough conditions. Soarwood is 75% lighter than regular wood. It is a necessary component for the construction of Eberron-style airships, and when worked into an airship, it becomes naturally lighter than air. 

^soarwood

#### Sparish Nut

Biome: Jungles

This herb is a powerful aphrodisiac. If successfully administered the DM/PC should act accordingly, but if a method of using dice to simulate its effect is wanted, anyone who attempts to seduce the recipient should have a bonus of +5 to their Persuasion checks for a period of 2d10 minutes. 

^sparish-nut

#### Sparkleberry

Biome: Plains, Forests, and Jungles

A single stalk bearing a number of curled leaves, the sweet berries of the plant are known throughout Faerun, and they sparkle radiantly in direct sunlight. Villagers often know of nearby patches of wild sparkle berries, and pick them in mid-summer. The berries have a variety of methods by which they are eaten. Fresh berries are often served with cheese, and many are processed into jams and jellies to be preserved for later. Consumption of the raw berries grants resistance to Radiant damage for 10 minutes while consumption of the jam or jelly grants the same resistance for 5 minutes. 

^sparkleberry

#### Spectreflower

Biome: Forests

This highly unusual plant grows in the deepest parts of dark forests, far from the eyes of civilization. The stalk is a blue-green color, and several pale leaves grow along the length. During nights of the full moon the plant buds a flower, which appears wispy and translucent. Attemping to touch the flower reveals that it is incorporeal, and has the substance of smoke. Come morning the flower disperses on the wind, sending the seeds of the flower on their path. The roots of the flower can be used to make an oil that allows blades to strike incorporeal creatures, called Ghostbane Oil. Using the roots of the Specterflower, alchemists are capable of distilling an oil, that when applied correctly, allows non-magical weapons to inflict full damage upon incorporeal creatures as if they were physical creatures. The benefit lasts only for a few swings, up to the DM’s discretion. 

^spectreflower

#### Spellbane

Biome: Mountains

A small but tenacious plant that grows in shadowed areas, clinging to rocks. The wide ragged leaves of the plant are filled with vibrant blue veins, and at night in the spring it produces small delicate blue flowers which crumble with the slightest touch. Surprisingly, the plant has an interesting effect upon magic users and magical creatures. Those that ingest parts of the plant lose the ability to cast spells and gain an increased resistance to magic for 3d4 days. 

^spellbane

#### Spelleater Ivy

Biome: Forests

An undergrowth plant resembling ivy with a silvery sheen to its leaves, sometimes mistaken for poison ivy. Any spells cast within 20' are absorbed by the ivy. It immediately grows a new 10'x10' section per level of the spell slot used. Direct and unprotected contact with the plant supposedly imbues or causes innate magical ability to surface in non-magic-users and magic users alike, granting a temporary wizard cantrip to the recipient. Eating or smoking the leaves causes astonishing visions and requires a DC 18 Wisdom Save vs Insanity. If collected and dried in large amounts, talented craftspeople can craft anti-magic armor. While helpful, the armor is also incredibly volatile, exploding after absorbing 1d4 spells, releasing all spells and burning the wearer for d8 equal to the amount of spells the armor has captured. 

^spelleater-ivy

#### Spiderbush

Biome: Jungles

Spiderbush is a small shrub, rarely growing larger than 2' in diameter, with waxy, light green leaves and an exposed woody root system. Tiny blue and white flowers develop on the tips of its branches, blooming year-round. If a Spiderbush does not receive sunlight for a 24-hour period it will use its root system to waddle or shuffle across the ground in search of light. Having stubby, makeshift legs when combined with frequently uneven jungle ground, Spiderbushes tend to lose their balance and tumble through the jungle. Due to their ambulatory nature and need for direct sunlight, Spiderbushes naturally cluster together in clearings or along the tree line near the shore of an island. Periods of extended rainfall have been known to trigger sizable migrations of hundreds, even thousands of Spiderbushes shuffling and tumbling through the jungle in search of the sun. 

^spiderbush

#### Spiderwort

Biome: Forests and Plains

This herb will cure poison from any spider bite if applied within 2 rounds. The successful application will negate the poisoned effect and heal the amount of poison damage dealt. This plant may be found anywhere in temperate regions where there is chalky soil. 

^spiderwort

#### Spirit Moss

Biome: Swamps

A pale white moss that often grows on dead trees in marshy environments. Those familiar with the moss know to avoid it, as it attacks the living. Those that approach within 10 feet cause the moss to violently thrash about, forcing those within the area to make Dexterity saving throws, DC 13, or be grappled by the moss. Escaping the grasp of the moss requires a Strength saving throw, DC 11. The moss then implants spores that burrow into the skin of the trapped creature, inflicting 1d6+1 damage per round. After the creature is implanted, they suffer Disadvantage to all attribute and skill checks, as a terrible malaise washes over them. Once the creature dies, the body sprouts a new mass of spirit moss. The implanted spores can be destroyed by the application of heat to the affected area on the round after implantation, or with a Lesser Restoration or similar magic after that point. 

^spirit-moss

#### Spotty Dragonfire

Biome: Forests, Plains, and Jungles

Wildflower with red, yellow, and orange petals that grows to 1-ft high and stretches 6 inches in diameter. The flower only blooms at night. It can be found in tropical to temperate regions and grows in single plants, except near red dragon lairs, where it glows plentifully. It can be made into Dragongrew, which grants a +1 bonus to all Constitution saves for 1 hour. 

^spotty-dragonfire

#### Spring Adonis

Biome: Forests and Mountains

This plant has small green leaves, and wide round yellow flowers. These flowers may be dried, and then eaten. They will then reduce the chance of a heart attack by half each day they are eaten. They may (at the DM’s discretion) also help to strengthen the heart of a person, who through age, injury, or other cause, has a weak heart. Eaten ten or more of these flowers at a time will temporarily raise the Constitution and Strength scores of a person by 1 for 2d12 hours, while reducing their Dexterity by 2 for the same period. In addition to this reduction, the recipient also has a chance of suffering a fatal heart attack 3d12 hours after taking such a massive dose (DC 14 Constitution Save). Certain tribes of barbarians in the mountain regions where this herb is found use the herb in order to help them go berserk in battle. These tribes, due to constant dosing from birth have only a small chance of suffering the heart attack (DC 8 Cons. Save). 

^spring-adonis

#### Stirge Traps

Biome: Swamps and Plains

These short plants grow several wide leaves covered in fine hairs, and a single large bell-shaped flower. The flower exudes a sticky sap that is deep red in hue, nearly the color of fresh blood, and also has a coppery aroma. The smell and coloration of the sap is intended to attract predators that prey on blood, such as stirge and giant mosquitos. While smaller insects are trapped by the sticky sap, the leaves are also covered in fine hairs, and when they are touched they curl up, trapping larger prey. Some farmers plant the flowers around the edges of their livestock pens, to keep stirge predation to a minimum, and in more urban areas pots of the sap are left out to trap mosquitos and other airborne pests. The plants are too small to effect people in the same manner. 

^stirge-traps

#### Stoneshroom

Biome: Underdark/Caves

Chalky, rock-looking fungus native to the Underdark that is both edible (1 stoneshroom =1 meal) and produces highly oxygenated spores that function as a form of breathable air. Also, for 24 hours after eating a stoneshroom, a creature can hold its breath twice as long as normal. Stoneshroom subsists on minerals in the rock and remains edible for 1 day after picking. With the proper nature check, smaller stoneshroom can be inserted into the nostrils to sustain breathing underwater or through poisonous gas. 

^stoneshroom

#### Stonestream

Biome: Arctic

Given the name by gnomes, Stonestream is a small lichen that produces a clear syrupy liquid that then drizzles down the sides of rocks that the lichen lives on. Collecting this syrup and heating into a tea for consumption will turn the user into stone for 2d4 hours. During this time, any poison or toxins, and most diseases, will be purged from the system into the stone surroundings. While turned to stone, the user takes one hit point of damage per hour, and any damage taken as a stone remains after the recipient has turned back from stone. 

^stonestream

#### Stonewort

Biome: Plains

A leafy plant with small pink flowers that grows in bunches in open fields. The plant is rather unremarkable, except for its tenacity and resilience. Farmers will often complain that it chokes out other crops, unless it is pulled up by the root and no remnants of the plant remains, and livestock often refuse to eat it. The true worth of the plant is when it is ground into a powder and turned into a paste. Spreading it on exposed flesh causes the skin to become hardened and stiff, resilient enough to resist slashes and stabs. Grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class for 2d6 minutes. However, more than a single application per day of the paste inflicts a -1 penalty on Dexterity based skill checks and saving throws when applied, as the skin begins to stiffen and become numb. 

^stonewort

#### Strawberry

Biome: Plains, Forests, Cities, and Mountains

These small red berries grow on very small ground plants with pale green, rounded leaves. Five berries should be bound into a bandage, which should then be applied to a leper’s sores. If the application is successful, that sore will deteriorate no further. They’re also just really tasty. 

^strawberry

#### Stygian Pumpkin

Biome: Plains and Forests

A sulfur-scented, dead-looking variety of pumpkin that can grow in any temperate region and is cultivated by goblins as food. It grows rapidly over large areas, rendering the soil poisonous to other plants. It can be made into Devil's Soap, which is a stinking black paste that grants resistance to fire damage for 1 hour. Can also be combined with Lizuara to create an ointment called Neverdeath that, when applied to the forehead of a recently dead creature, will bring the character back from the dead up to 7 days from its death. If the resurrection ritual is completed improperly, the character becomes an undead. After successful application of the ointment, the character being treated must make 3 death saving throws unbeknownst to the rest of the party: 

3 successes or 2 successes and 1 failure will return to character to full health, fully living. 2 failures and 1 success will return the character to conscious undeath, returning the player as a revenant. 3 failures will return the character as a full undead, with the helpful intervention of an evil deity of death, returning the character as a Death Knight with no control over their actions. The Death Knight will attempt to fight, but can also be turned back to the ally as a revenant state if the ointment is applied once more and the Death Knight fails a DC 16 Cons. Save.

#### Suaeysit

Biome: Forests

A dark black mushroom with greyish markings along the undersides, this fungus grows in shadowed forests in cool to cold climes. Suaeysit mushrooms can be eaten directly or dried and ground into tinctures or otherwise prepared. The mushrooms give the imbiber a rush of energy, clearing the mind and raising the spirits. However, they are highly addictive, and care must be taken when preparing and prescribing dosages. Often used to counteract shock in emergency situations. (Temporarily adds +1 to all stats – no top limit to natural statistics, but it does not add to magically enhanced statistics – and saving throws, and relieves effects of fatigue. This effect lasts for 1d4 hours, after which the user operates at -1 to all statistics and saving throws, and feels even more fatigued for 2d6 hours. The negative effects of "coming down" can, of course, be counteracted by taking more the drug, with resultant addictive effects of gut-wrenching pain and 5 poison damage per day.)

#### Sunberry Bush

Biome: Plains

A large bush with light green oval leaves, the branches are studded with small thorns. During the spring months the bush is covered with small golden flowers. The golden berries of the bush grow with small protrusions, giving them the appearance of a small flaming sun. While the freshly cut berries are sour, leaving them to sit in the sun for a day or two after being picked turns them remarkably sweet. The berries are often picked for Sunberry Wine. This wine is remarkably popular with Rangers, increasing the effective range of their weapons by 10 feet and granting them immunity to environmental cold, as well as flushed cheeks.

#### Sunflower of Pelor

Biome: Plains, Underdark/Caves

Large sunflower commonly found where undead were destroyed by a cleric’s Destroy Undead. If petals are treated with various oils and solvents, the petals can be consumed to bolstering spells relating to the creation of light, doubling spell effect area.

#### Surane

Biome: Coastal

A tall, hardy reed capable of growing up to 10’ tall, found mostly along salty and brackish water in colder climates. When mixed with oil and left to sit for a period of three days, the resulting mixture can be applied to the neck and will allow the character to breather underwater (and only underwater) for 2d4 hours.

#### Sussur (Deeproot)

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A rare, magical and magic-dependent tree with long gnarled branches and banyan-like aerial roots found in the largest Underdark caverns. Grows to 60 ft in height, has very few leaves, and absorbs magic, creating massive (1d20 x 100 ft.) anti-magic fields.

#### Suth

Biome: Forests, Jungles, Plains

A tree with dark grey bark, and branches which sprout almost horizontally from the trunk for some distance before abruptly changing angles. The branches of multiple trees growing close together often grow together, becoming a tangled mass, and sometimes creating natural walls. The olive-green leaves are long and fluffy, but sport a spike at the end which often makes attempting to push through the interlaced branches a painful task. The wood of the tree is renowned for being hard and durable, making the process of cutting them down very difficult. Thus, in some areas where lumbering has cleared away large swaths of trees, there are large copses of tangled Suth trees left untouched. When the trees have been cut down, however, it was found that they work wonderfully as shield-wood, especially since soaking it in water before battle keeps it from catching fire.

#### Swampwalker

Biome: Jungles and Swamps

A curious plant that has caused more than a few strange tales from the rural villagers, the Swampwalker seems to stand out of the water, supported by a mass of tendrils, and sprouting a clump of pink flowers that attract various insects. Each tendril is the thickness of a finger, and due to slow currents in the swamp, the tendrils often clump together or break off entirely, causing the plant to look like a looming figure standing on the surface of the brackish water. One legend has it that the plants come alive during the darkest of nights. They stalk nearby villages hoping to catch the unwary and drag them back to watery graves. Whether this is true or not is completely unknown.

#### Sweet Arcane

Biome: Rivers and Swamps

A short river grass found alongside rivers and other bodies of water in humid, tropical environments. When this grass is ground into a cud with honey, the resulting decoction is a syrupy sweet treat that will allow spellcasters to memorize and prepare one extra spell per day. The level of the spell is determined by the number of grass used (12 stalks per level), and can only be of a level for which the caster has slots. Last 1d4 days.

#### Sweet Trefoile

Biome: Rivers

This feathery, slightly invasive waterplant will halve falling damage for 1d6 minutes after consumption.

#### Swordstalks

Biome: Deserts and Jungles

A succulent plant with a cluster of three broad and thick leaves that grow from the ground, and sprouting a single small blue flower on the tips of each leaf each spring. The swordstalk often grows in tropical places, and often in the sandy soil near beaches and deserts. The broad and heavy leaves of the plant are often severed and dried, and the result is a fairly resilient weapon with a jagged edge on either side, capable of cutting through flesh almost as easily as a steel sword. The resulting weapon functions as either a short sword or a longsword, perfect for the discerning druid. However, on any critical fail on a roll to hit with the swordstalk, that the weapon is broken and rendered useless. T
