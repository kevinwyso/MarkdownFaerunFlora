#### Taggit

Biome: Jungles

A family of rare plants, closely guarded where they grow in any number, with oily, deep-green leaves in the shape of stars growing from a central woody-stemmed bush. These oily leaves can be steeped in hot water to extract an oil, that when applied via contact in large quantities, acts as a paralytic that was previously used for surgery until its use as a poison for the torture and assassination of a powerful king several decades ago. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw vs. poison or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is paralyzed and unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage but remains paralyzed except for the movement of their eyes.

#### Tahtoalethi (Wishfern)

Biome: Mountains and Jungles

Mystical plant that produces a singular light blue fruit, capable of granting a wish, every 100 years on the night of the winter solstice. Seed sells for 25000 gp, devilishly hard to cultivate. Once picked, fruits never spoil. 

^tahtoalethi-wishfern

#### Tai-Gi

Biome: Plains

The ground and powdered root of this small, almost-flat plant will, if eaten, increase the efficiency of all a person’s five senses by 5 times for a period of 2d6 hours. They will be able to see five times as far, and things five times as small, track by scent alone, hear the smallest sounds, and even taste many poisons on their tongues, granting double advantage on perception rolls for any sense. A side effect is that they are also five times as susceptible to pain. (For each hit point of damage, the person must roll under their constitution minus damage taken. For example, if someone with a Constitution of 15 was hit for 6 points of damage, they would have to roll under 9 on a d20. If the person ever takes more damage than their Constitution score while under the influence of this herb, they have an 80% chance of instant death, just from the pain.) 

^tai-gi

#### Takara Bulb

Biome: Forests and Mountains

A large bulbous mass that grows a half-dozen shoots, each ending in a single, large leaf. The bulb is dark brown or even red in coloration, while the leaves are a light green with red veins. During the spring a single large red flower forms at the center of the bulb. The bulb can be harvested and eaten raw, although it often tastes better after having been cooked. Many small mountain villages cultivate the bulb, as the plant grows well in rocky soil. (Heals for 1d4-1 hit points if eaten raw or 1d6+1 hit points if cooked). 

^takara-bulb

#### Tamarind

Biome: Jungles

This low-hanging tree fruit will quench the thirst. However, it does not replace the water in their system. A person can still die of thirst, they just won't feel thirsty. Because of this fact, its use can actually be quite dangerous. 

^tamarind

#### Tamariske (Blacktear)

Biome: Jungles

This herb will cleanse the body through the wounds, removing all disease in the form of black ooze that will drip from open wounds. If no wounds are open at the time, the ichor will instead ooze from the tear ducts, giving the Tamariske its nickname. It does not cure lost hit points. 

^tamariske-blacktear

#### Tangara Kelp

Biome: Oceans

Growing out of the seabed, this dark-green rope-like kelp grows in shallow sea waters near coastlines and reefs and is both a blessing and a bane to sailors. The kelp often tangles oars, fishing nets, crab traps, and rudders. However, more than a few sailors stuck in the doldrums near a desolate island have survived off of little more than the purified water contained within the kelp’s stalks and barrel-like fruit, as well as the schools of fish that dwell among the fronds. 

^tangara-kelp

#### Tangled Waybread

Biome: Plains

A soft, flowing, amber grain on a flexible stalk that grows in large patches in the middle of open fields. The grain often blows violently even in a low breeze, and will tangle up in itself, creating giant mats of grain that then slowly dies due to cramping and underwatering. The grain can be ground and turned into a meal that, in turn, can be mixed with water and baked to create a simple but filling flatbread. 

^tangled-waybread

#### Tansy

Biome: Cities and Plains

Tansy grows in small patches of 1 to 3-foot stalked plants with yellow button flowers. Commonly grown in cities outside of homes and personal properties, Tansy has traditionally been used to keep away flies and pests. According to legends of old, Tansy comes from the word “athanasia” which means “immortality,” and the use of this word for the flower relates to a tale of monks reading about local flora and a story about a hero of yore, Brandalier the Brave, in which the ruler of Brandalier’s kingdom states “Take him hence, and when he has tasted immortality let him return to us,” referring to this flower, or something similar. 

^tansy

#### Taran’ka

Biome: Deserts

A small desert plant that mostly grows underground in the form of a tuber. A singular leaf sticks out from the sand and typically resembles a dead plant. However, if the tuber is harvested and cut into pieces, a single coin sized piece will cure any non-magical disease in 1d8 hours. 

^taranka

#### Tateesha

Biome: Deserts

The Tateesha bush is a low-lying shrub with long thin leaves and small brown nuts. These nuts may be chewed to provide a shortlived feeling of euphoria, and are mildly addictive. They have the side effect of staining the teeth, making it easy to find a tateesha addict. The flowers, called silks, bloom only in spring, and if gathered and dried for one week form a powerful narcotic which may be smoked. For 2d10 minutes after smoking, the persons’ insight skill is increased by +2, but for 1d4 hours after this, a state of distortion ensues, and the recipient’s Intelligence and Wisdom drop by -2 from their normal levels. Prolonged use causes the user to collapse into an almost dreamlike trance. The drug is highly addictive, and after only two uses, the user must make a DC 16 Cons. Save or become addicted, with a +1 to the save DC after each dose from here on out. Addicts lapse into the dreamlike trance stated above until their next exposure to the drug or until cured of addiction. 

^tateesha

#### Tekkil

Biome: Swamps

A succulent swamp plant with fat red leaves, which when chewed, function as an analgesic drug. Initially no effect, but after a few minutes, the user becomes almost entirely fearless, gaining +5 to Wisdom and Intelligence Saves against fear, and becoming immune to the Frightened effect for the next 1d20+10 minutes. Drug also grants a -5 penalty to all Dexerity saves for the next 1d4 hours. Overdose occurs with a second dose during the original duration and causes halved movement speed for 2d4 hours as well as the negative Dexterity side-effect. 

^tekkil

#### Tempin

Biome: Forests

A bushy climbing vine with tubular yellow flowers, the leaves and flowers of tempin can be boiled and made into a poultice that will draw out poisons from bites and stings and allow the wound to heal cleanly and without complications. (When poultice is applied within 1 round of taking poison damage, the recipient may make an extra Cons. Save vs poison to avoid the Poisoned effect. Also grants +1 hit points to recovery hit dice expended during every short rest for the first 2 days after poultice is applied.) 

^tempin

#### Tephrosia

Biome: Forests

Tephrosia consists of a small woody stem, with fern like leaves along its length, and the plant is topped by several small flowers (or in summer, seedpods). Either the flowers or the seeds may be boiled in water and then drunk to calm the recipient. This is very useful when a person is delirious, or otherwise insane. It also has a mild pain-relieving effect and may be given to the slightly wounded. The seedpods are more effective than the flowers and may also be dried. This herb is mildly addictive and should be used with care (DC 11 Cons. Save, addiction causes mild insomnia, turning long rests into short rests). 

^tephrosia

#### Terbas

Biome: Plains

The leaf of this plant must be applied to the site of nerve damage or consumed to fix brain damage. If successful, the rate of healing for such damage will be doubled on each day of use. 

^terbas

#### Tereeka Root

Biome: Rivers and Coastal

Slimy white tuber with a bitter taste, native to shaded, sandy ground in temperate climates. After chewing it for one minute a creature is granted +10 temporary hit points and then only regains health while resting as if under the care of a healer for the next 12 hours. 

^tereeka-root

#### Thalsen Weed

Biome: Arctic

A tough yellowish stalk that grows stiff triangle shaped leaves, the weed is despised throughout the Dalelands to Cor Myr. Some believe the weed to have been magically created, as it grows from seed to mature adult in a matter of days, often seeming to appear instantaneously. Once the weed reaches maturity, it produces a small cluster of white flowers. The petals of the flowers are coated with a dusty powder that causes a slight rash if it comes into contact with the skin. These petals are sometimes picked to create Itching Powder (When coming into contact with bare flesh, the victim must make a Constitution saving throw, DC 13, or begin itching for the next 2d4 hours, or until the powder is washed off.). The rapidly growing weed is said to overcome crops nearly overnight, choking out carefully planted fields, and destroying months of work. Most livestock also refuse to eat the weed, with the exception of goats. Thus, many farmers that live in areas where Thalsen Weed thrives also keep a small number of goats that they let wander in the outer edges of their lands. 

^thalsen-weed

#### Thanalayla

Biome: Jungles

A long stalk covered in small thorns and ending in a thick bulb, the plant hangs down from the branches of other trees. Thanalalya is a predatory plant, the stalks have their roots embedded in branches of trees, yet they cause no harm to their host tree. The plant instead secretes a sicky resin that smells musky and attracts insects and small birds. Smaller insects are trapped in the resin, while the stalk curls around birds that would be capable of breaking free of the resin, gripping and impaling them with the thorns. The resin slowly dissolves the prey, providing nutrients to the Thanalalya. The Thanalayla, according to wives’ tales, also wards off lesser fey and this may be the case because pixies can also get caught in its sticky resin. 

^thanalayla

#### Thelmallow Flower

Biome: Swamps

A floating plant that inhabits marshes and swamps, the plant produces wide, waxy leaves that arc minutely out of the water, which are often the haven for mosquitos. The plant also buds large pale flowers with ragged petals that attract swamp flies. Grinding up the flower creates a paste which, when combined with paste made from Vaundyr Vine, is used to create Spellslayer wine. Although the wine is quite refreshing, tasty, and light, it also reduces the magical ability of spellcasters, causing a permanent decrease to the amount of spell slots available at a given level (at the DM’s discretion). 

^thelmallow-flower

#### Thir

Biome: Arctic

A grey-white lichen that grows off-shoots that resemble a short, spiky grass. The grass can be used in a compress or bandage to heal up to 4 points of damage if applied within 5 rounds of taking damage. 

^thir

#### Thimbleweed

Biome: Plains and Forests

A spiky, medium-length grass that grows in patches in areas of direct sunlight. As summer turns into fall, the tips of the grass begin to swell and turn into white, thimble shaped flowers. These flowers are a common cure for fevers and involved in a remedy that allows for a delay in the onset of illness or its symptoms. 

^thimbleweed

#### Thistledown

Biome: Arctic and Plains

A very tall strain of thistle, growing often to 8 feet tall or more, can be harvested for the fibers within the central stalk. These fibers can be turned into a silken fabric by elves that can be worked into armor to make it easier to move in, increasing AC by 1 and increasing movement speed by 5 feet. Crafting with thistledown requires master leveling training from an elven craftsperson or a nature check of 25+. 

^thistledown

#### Thornapple

Biome: Mountains

This is a small ground hugging plant. Its seeds are about a quarter of an inch in diameter, and are covered in small thorns. A single seed is very effective as a minor pain reliever. It will ease small pains, such as headaches or minor muscular pains for 3d4 hours. The pain relief is almost instantaneous. 

^thornapple

#### Throw-Waxe

Biome: Plains

This herb will heal any scars in as little as a month if applied on a weekly basis. 

^throw-waxe

#### Thurl

Biome: Mountains

The clove of Thurl must be brewed for one whole day. When the mixture is drunk it will restore 1 hit point and grant the user 5 hit points worth of resistance toward fire and cold damage. 

^thurl

#### Thyme

Biome: Plains and Cities

Thyme can grow up to a foot in height. A small, ornamental evergreen, Thyme has tiny dark green leaves. In spring it has many sweet scented mauve flowers. The smell is so strong that the herb is often smelt before it is seen. These flowers must be dried and then mixed with fresh, clear water to produce an antiseptic lotion. This lotion can then be applied to infected wounds. Aside from its common uses, Thyme is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease. 

^thyme

#### Tickleweed

Biome: Jungles

Although Tickleweed grows as a thick, grass-like carpet of cylindrical dark green leaf-blades, 3"-4" in length, resembling typical grass, its actions set it apart. Unlike normal grasses, Tickleweed prefers to grow on nearly vertical surfaces and will even thrive in dark places, assuming there is ample moisture. The cylindrical leaf-blades are highly sensitive to even the subtlest shifts in ambient temperature, so they move and shift continually. Tickleweed stretches towards increases in temperature and away from decreases. Each leaf moves independently causing the plants to appear to ripple and shiver with waves. Even the simple act of walking past a patch of Tickleweed will trigger a flurry of movement. Tickleweed bloom very rarely with circular flowers of red or white with a central black "eye". The flowers are prized by alchemists as they amplify concoctions related to detection, reaction, and rapid or fluid movement (up to DM’s discretion). 

^tickleweed

#### Torchstalk

Biome: Forests and Underdark/Caves

Non-magical mushroom that can serve as a torch. Takes 1d4-1 minutes to ignite, but burns for 24 hours shedding bright illumination in 10 ft radius. Has a sub-species that explodes into choking spores after 30 seconds of burning, requiring anyone within 20 ft to make a DC 15 Constitution save to negate 1d10 poison damage. DC 18 Nature allows differentiation between the two types. 

^torchstalk

#### Torment Toadstool

Biome: Swamps

Large blue mushrooms found in swamps all over Faerun, most people are careful not to step on the toadstools. Some villagers purposefully propagate and harvest the mushrooms in order to make a particularly earthy tasting ale. Those that step on the toadstool cause it to rupture and release a cloud of spores within a 5-ft radius. Those that inhale the spores must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated while vomiting for the next minute. 

^torment-toadstool

#### Trathua

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A thick black vine that grows along the floors of caves and caverns and subsists on the nutrients leftover from the meals of Giant Spiders. Cutting open a Trathua Vine and drinking the liquid inside will make the character impervious to poison damage and negative poisoned effects from spiders for 2d6 hours. However, the liquid inside the vines clings to the mouth like cobwebs. 

^trathua

#### Troll Poppy

Biome: Plains and Forests

A bright blue poppy flower commonly used to bribe trolls for safe passage through a monster-filled area. Trolls go wild for these flowers and will eat them as soon as they lay eyes on them. Usually found in large patches in open fields, 2d8 flowers can be harvested per 5 foot by 5 foot area. In addition to their use with trolls, the petals of troll poppies can be dried, crumbled, and smoked. When smoked, user will not be able to rest or sleep for the next 6d4 hours. During this time, the user can never lose consciousness unless dead, not from exhaustion, magical sleep, or poisons. After this period has passed, the user falls unconscious for 1d4 hours. 

^troll-poppy

#### Trueroot

Biome: Forests

A legendary sapling that is said to have been accidentally created during a series of experiments involving the repeated grafting of various magically enhanced roots onto treants, from which seeds were planted to create saplings that were then grafted with each other and so on. The trueroot saplings are said to have pulled magical energy from an unknown place, and this magical energy could be channeled into other plants to accelerate their growth to be 10 times faster, or be channeled by spellcasters to give perfect health and “almost limitless spellcasting”. The trueroot died after small cuttings were taken to propagate it and there have been no known successes in recreating it. 

^trueroot

#### Twilight Birch

Biome: Forests

The bark of this tree is a pale white, and quite smooth. The leaves of the tree are small, waxy and dark, and spend the day curled tightly, only to open at night. During colder months the tree sprouts small purple flowers that blossom at night. Legend says that the trees first erupted from the ground during a fight between an avatar of Shar, and an avatar of Selune. During the fight the avatar of Shar was wounded, and where her drops of her blood fell upon several saplings, they were forever changed. It has been noted that the trees were once found more commonly in places where the Shadow Weave was most prominent. The wood is soft and flexible when first cut, but hardens over the course of several days, allowing craftsmen to work easily on freshly cut wood to easily create ornate pieces. Once hardened, the wood retains the shape it was crafted into. The wood is often used to create furniture such as elaborately carved chairs, tables, and desks. Additionally, the wood is used to crat intricately detailed scepters, wands, and staves, and a wooden weapon made of Twilight Birch is said to do extra damage to celestials (+3 force damage to successful against celestials). In addition, when a magical item is crafted using Twilight Birch, and used to cast a Death or Trickery Domain spell (even if used by non-Clerics), it allows the spell to be cast one level higher without using a higher-level spell slot. This ability can be used once per long rest, and only at night. 

^twilight-birch

#### Twilight Green

Biome: Jungles

Distant belladonna relative, DC 16 Cons. Save to negate 2d8 poison damage if ingested. If used by a spellcaster during a spell that causes life drain, it increases damage by 1 point per spell level. 

^twilight-green

#### Tyrant’s Mercy

Biome: Jungles

A small, white fungus consisting of only mycelium with no reproductive bodies, Tyrant’s Mercy is a slow-moving fungus that grows mainly on decaying woody matter. When harvested and mashed with a small amount of mercury, the resulting paste is sticky and white with a slightly pearlescent sheen. A contact poison, the paste is often applied to locations that the victim’s flesh would commonly be in contact with, such as sword handles, the insides of crowns and hates, or even on the lids of toilets, repeated exposure may cause the target to slowly lose their mind. Upon each contact, the target must make a DC 10 Cons. Save against poison. Upon 3 consecutive failures, the target then rolls on the Short-Term Madness table (DMG pg. 259). After this initial mild insanity, and more contact with the poison, another 3 consecutive failures will cause a Long-Term Madness effect (DMG pg. 260), and another 3 consecutive failures after that will cause an Indefinite Madness (DMG pg. 260). 

^tyrants-mercy

#### Tyrant’s Sword

Biome: Plains

Coarse grass with broad sharp leaves with silver edges that grows to 2-ft in height. Sporadically found in tundra and temperate plains, it grows slowly and doesn't compete well against other grasses. It can be made into Frost Lotion, Medicine Check of 12+, to heal 2d4 points of cold damage. U
