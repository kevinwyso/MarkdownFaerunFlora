#### Valerian

Biome: Plains

Valerian grows to a height of about 3 feet, and has one hollow and furry stem. It has large, pale green, serrated leaves along the length of this stalk which slits into flowers stems with small pink flowers at its top. The root is the useful part of this plant and should be grated into boiling water and the resulting infusion drunk in order to ease the spasms of somebody who is subject to fits or seizures. A successful application will stop all fits for 1d12 hours. The scent of the bruised or cut root also can be used to attract rats. According to some versions of the legend, the Pied Piper of Fendaire-by-the-Sea used this herb to lead the rats from the town.

#### Varenia

Biome: Forests

A tall, woody-stemmed flower that grows during spring and summer months. The blooms are almost a foot across and a bright crimson red. The inside is filled with a large quantity of nectar, making the flower very popular among a large variety of birds. During the fall, as the plant starts to die in cooler temperatures, the nectar begins to spoil and take in bits and pieces of disintegrating plant matter which turns the nectar into a thicker, foul-smelling salve that can be applied to regenerate a lost limb or body part. The regeneration cycle takes 3 full days. There is a 10% chance the limb will be mutated in some manner

#### Vaundyr Vine

Biome: Swamps and Jungles

A thorny, thin vine that grows in wetter areas such as swamps and jungles. The waxy leaves are ground to create Alarvaun, a component for Spellslayer wine along with Thelmallow Flower. Although the wine is quite refreshing, tasty, and light, it also reduces the magical ability of spellcasters, causing a permanent decrease to the amount of spell slots available at a given level (at the DM’s discretion).

#### Verdant Goeleth

Biome: Plains and Cities

A large, pink vine fruit about the size of a small watermelon. Commonly pressed and fermented to create a dwarvish wine called Woebegetter Wine. This wine has the strange side-effect of allowing the drinker to hear the thoughts of anyone in a 5-mile radius of themselves that has been drinking Woebegetter Wine in the past 6 hours. This can be really useful if you're trying to coordinate a silent attack, and it can be dreadful if the people you're attacking are also drinking Woebegetter Wine, but keeping their thoughts mute so that you don't know that they know what you're doing. The effects last for 1d20 minutes per cup.

#### Vinuk

Biome: Plains and Forests

If this herb is wafted under the nose of an unconscious person, it will immediately awaken the person. It will only wake up a person who is unconscious due to alcohol or fainting etc., not that caused by physical damage. And just because the person is conscious does not mean that they are coherent.

#### Violet Slime

Biome: Swamps

Lurking on the surface of stagnant pools of water deep in the marshes, this slime is deadly to those that are caught unaware. Noticing the shimmer of violet indicating the slime lingering on the surface requires a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) skill check. While entering the pool the slime remains inert, but once the victim emerges from the pool, the slime clings to them. The slime becomes highly corrosive when removed from the pool and inflicts 2d6 acid damage per round until it is washed off with water or exposed to bright light or fire. The corrosion only damages organic material, thus ignoring metal armor.
