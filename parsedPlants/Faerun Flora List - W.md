#### Waredan

Biome: Forests

A surprisingly hardy dwarf tree that grows about 5’ or slightly less. The hard, waxy leaves of this tree can be combined sugar water in a boiling process to yield a concoction that, when injected into the bloodstream of a lycanthrope, will cause the lycanthrope to be unable to change form for 12 hours, even in the presence of magic that would cause this change instantaneously, like the spell Moonbeam.

#### Watercress

Biome: Rivers

A very small, leafy green that is commonly eaten in salads or as an added green in many meals. Eating this green in combination with a day’s rations will replenish one hit die if consumed separately from a long rest. Aside from its common uses, Watercress is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.

#### Waterorb

Biome: Coastal

Bulbous aquatic fungus that grows in boulder-like patches in some seaside areas and tidal pools. Can be used a source of fresh drinking water near the ocean.

#### Waxtree

Biome: Forests

Waxtrees have large, fuzzy, almost white leaves that grow in bunches at the ends of twisted, dark brown, woody branches that are 1-3 inches thick. While most commonly growing to a height of 2-3 feet, some Wax Trees have been known to grow as large as 8 feet tall. A shallow and spreading root system robs nearby plants of food and moisture causing these trees to be found with few neighbors, even in areas of otherwise dense vegetation. The branches, if broken, ooze a translucent purple, viscous fluid that smells vaguely of citrus. The wax burns cleanly and evenly making it a good alternative to beeswax, and alchemists often seek it out as a foundation for magical glues and thickeners. Exceptionally skilled alchemists are able to use this wax to create a putty that can *permanently* change the shape and structure of facial features. The would-be master of disguise should be cautious however as minor, even accidental, tweaks to this formula will create a putty that causes organic matter (like faces) to dissolve and melt away in a matter of seconds.

#### Waxworm

Biome: Forests

A strange and small plant that is often found growing on rotting logs and animal droppings, the plant lacks much of a root system. The leaves are small and curled around the flowering part of the plant. Once the plant reaches maturity, the leaves fall away to reveal tightly curled pale flowers that appear to be large maggots to the untrained eye. Birds often eat the flowers, thus spreading the seeds far and wide. Grinding the flowers into paste and boiling them produces a waxy substance which woodworkers can use to seal their work from moisture. Painters also seek out the substance, as it causes the colors to resist fading over the years.

#### Weeping Tree

Biome: Forests

A species of deciduous tree that closely resembles oak, the weeping trees are often left alone while other nearby trees are cut down to use as timber, as strong superstitions surround the tree. One tale speaks of a nature demigoddess long since forgotten being banished to inhabit the trees after losing a fierce battle for dominance of the nature domain with Kalancha. Another speaks of a powerful druid sacrificing herself to save the forest, and her ghost living on within the branches of the weeping trees. During autumn the trees begin losing their leaves and begin dropping their seeds, which is what creates the sound the trees are known for. Each seed has a small petal, which is shaped in such a way that when it falls it creates a sound similar to a person softly crying. As the trees often grow in clusters and they drop several thousand seeds each, over the course of a few weeks in autumn it sounds as if the trees are constantly weeping.

#### Weirwood

Biome: Forests

Rare oak-like tree with leaves that are a silver-sheen brown on top and velvet black on the underside, often protected by Dryads and Treants. Can grow huge and many-branched, will not burn from non-magical fire, and imparts a warm clear tone to musical instruments made from it. It can replace oak or holly in any spell, and living Weirwood has quadruple fire resistance (no means to preserve this quality after harvesting is known). Weirwood within the illumination radius of a magical light source emits light as a candle for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area. 

^weirwood

#### Werasa

Biome: Plains and Cities

A short, leafy bush that produces small lilac flowers on the spring solstice. 2d8 flowers can be harvested from a single bush, and the petals of these flowers can be crushed and sprinkled over food to preserve the food for 1 week. There will be a faint trace of generic flower-like notes in the taste. 

^werasa

#### White Byrony

Biome: Forests

This climbing vine has greenish-white star shaped flowers, each bearing five petals, and has green berries which turn red when ripe. It has a root, something like a huge turnip, and this root should be ground up and boiled in water and drunk as a cure for pneumonia. In addition, the berries are commonly collected to make Byrony Jam, a staple of breakfasts in the norther climes. 

^white-byrony

#### Whitecandle

Biome: Plains

A tall, flowered plant with silvery-green leaves. When the flowers are mixed with water or wine and applied directly to a wound, they act as a painkiller. (Grants 1d4 temporary hit points to an injured target immediately, but these points are lost as the effect wears off in 2 hours. Further applications before the previous one has worn off are ineffective.) 

^whitecandle

#### Whistling Cactus

Biome: Deserts

Growing on the edges of the desert are these pale green cacti with long yellow spines. The cactus grows as a single cylindrical body, and when moisture is abundant the cactus will sprout several purple flowers near the top. After the flowers wither and fall off, they leave deep holes in the surface of the cactus. When the desert winds pass over these holes, they resonate at an unusual frequency that creates an eerie sound that can be heard for over a mile. Many nomadic tribes will avoid areas near the cactus, believing the plants to hold the souls of the damned that howl for eternity.

#### Wild Fireclover

Biome: Plains

Brilliant orange-red summer-flower found in temperate plains and farmland. Crushed petals give of a lovely smell for 1 week. The stem can be made into a substance called Mindfire, which when added to an ingested poison, imposes a -2 penalty to Cons. Saves to those who fail a save against the poison, and forces casters to make concentration checks (DC 15 + spell level) to cast spells. 

^wild-fireclover

#### Wildwood (Saelas)

Biome: Jungles

A flexible wood that can be worked into armor (counts as masterwork, +1 AC, Dex +1, negates stealth disadvantage on heavy armor styles). Wildwood heals a point of damage over 24 hours if exposed to sunlight for at least 1 hour, or, heals 5 points if also left to soak in water for 8 hours. Cost is double that of ordinary masterwork equivalent, but crating time is unaffected, and crafting requires craft (woodworking). 

^wildwood-saelas

#### Willow-Herb

Biome: Plains and Swamps

The plant grows to about three feet in height. It has long hairy leaves and large purplish-pink flowers. The smoke of this herb will keep away snakes and other minor vermin. One dose burns for about five minutes. 

^willow-herb

#### Winclamit

Biome: Jungles

Each Winclamit tree bears but one fruit per year, resembling an apple the size of a watermelon at the precipice of the tree. When this fruit is eaten it will restore 1d100 hit points to the recipient. The fruit can be stored for up to 2 months in a dry sealed container. 

^winclamit

#### Windwhip Tree

Biome: Plains

Growing in small clumps in vast open plains, the tree grows straight up until it splits into thousands of willowy branches. Each of these branches are thin and whip-like, and are covered in small clumps of light green leaves and small red thorns. The bark of the tree is dark brown with lighter brown spots around the base of the tree. When the wind blows across the plains, the flexible branches and trunk bend far over. When the wind suddenly abates, the trunk abruptly snaps back into place, and the flexible branches make a popping noise not unlike the crack of a whip. This also causes the tree to fling their seeds far and wide. While the springiness of the wood makes it unacceptable to use for most construction, it has been quite popular in the construction of ballistae.

#### Wispstalks

Biome: Underdark/Caves, Forests, and Jungles

This incredibly rare fungus has become something of a fable among herbalists. It is reported to have a large, translucent-blue bulbous cap growing atop a thin stem, and to normally form in small clusters deep within damp cave environments and forests. When consumed, the recipient first takes 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 15. Cons. Save to keep it down. On a successful save, the recipient will gain the secondary effect of the wispstalk, becoming transparents but not invisible for 1d8 minutes; on a failed save, nothing happens except for the recipient coughing up what part of the fungus they tried to get down. 

^wispstalks

#### Witchweed

Biome: Jungles and Plains

A plant whose leaves and stalks can be refined into a paste, which is then rolled into a smoke-stick of sorts that creates 10 ft cube of light smoke (no concealment) that forces casters to make a concentration check as if casting defensively or lose focus on the spell due to bouts of uncontrollable sneezing. The smoke is effective for 30 seconds.

#### Witchweave Palm

Biome: Jungles

A single Witchweave Palm Tree is comprised of three to five trunks, 10" to 12" in diameter, that grow in tight clusters and can reach 25' to 50' in height. The fronds of a mature Witchweave are approximately 3' long before splitting into 7 to 10 pale green leaves with drooping, fibrous tips that grow for another 2' to 3'. It is the numerous white fibers, resembling hair, appearing in the splits of the leaf tips that give the Witchweave its name. These leaves are prized by the Lizardfolk natives of the Swordfish Islands who harvest, dry and process them into rope and rough cloth. The Witchweave blooms with small yellow flowers that give way to oblong, reddish fruit about the size of a human thumb. If the fruits are dried, wrapped in fresh green Witchweave leaves and burned, a thick, deep blue smoke with a sweet, musky odor is produced. This smoke acts as a potent anesthetic to exposed flesh, and the Lizardfolk are known to fill tents and lodges with it for both medical and spiritual reasons. It is rumored that some of the Lizardfolk's powerful shaman are able to refine the fruit of the Witchweave even further to create potent healing salves and unguents, but if true, these secrets are highly guarded.

#### Wittlewort

Biome: Jungles and Forests

Herb with green gossamer-like fronds which, due to its rapid growth cycle, is found only in the spring in temperate, subtropical or tropical areas. Deters slugs and other pests. If powdered, it can be made into Wittlewort brew, which grants those under Charm effects another saving throw (if the effect allowed one).

#### Wizard Hats

Biome: Underdark/Caves

A small conical mushroom that grows in the Underdark. The stem of the mushroom is pale white, and the cap is generally light orange to dark ochre in color, and sometimes covered in spots. Drow often collect the mushroom, as even though it is bitter while it is still fresh, cooking the fungus over an open flame causes it to shrink and take on a surprisingly meaty flavor. Some underkdarkdwelling chefs send out foraging parties to harvest the mushroom so that it can be prepared for feasts. 

^wizard-hats

#### Wolfsbane

Biome: Plains

This small (15-cm) plant has black green leaves, sawed deeply several times, and three flower stalks with tiny white flowers and brown seed pods. The flowers can be crushed into dust and carried in the pocket to have the effect of granting a +2 on a Constitution saving throw vs poison to avoid lycanthropy. The protection lasts for 2d4 x 10 minutes and makes tracking from lycanthropes harder. In addition, the seeds can be consumed (DC 20 Cons. Save) to fully avoid the repercussions of lycanthropy. 

^wolfsbane

#### Wolfweed

Biome: Mountains

Similar in appearance to Wolfsbane, this plant can be made into a substance called Journeyman Serum, which provides a +2 bonus on constitution checks to avoid damage from a forces march 

^wolfweed

#### Woodrose

Biome: Plains, Forests and Jungles

If steeped in wine and the resulting wine mixture drunk, this herb causes people to become very merry. Anyone who wishes to resist its effect can do so, if they make a DC 19 Cons. Save vs poison. 

^woodrose

#### Wood Sorrel

Biome: Plains and Forests

This is a small plant with leaves in three parts, like a shamrock. The flowers are bell shaped and are white with a dash of blue. The leaves must be crushed and dried for two weeks before use. This herb keeps people cool. It is obviously invaluable in desert regions. It doubles the person’s ability to endure heat effects, but does not counteract dehydration, etc. 

^wood-sorrel

#### Wormwood

Biome: Forests and Jungles

The effects of this herb last for two hours. During this time the character is granted +10 temporary hit points and can function beyond the point of exhaustion. Wormwood normally grows to about four feet in height. It has a stiff and angular stem, reddish brown in color. It has deeply incised smooth leaves which are silvery white with a slight tinge of green. It has small, yellow-green flowers arranged in long spikes at the top of the stem. The herb is also a rather effective insect repellent and is often left with clothing to keep fleas away. It also makes a very effective antiseptic when mixed with Rue (Intelligence check to remove all infection from a wound within 5d6 hours, healing an additional 2d6 during the next short rest to whoever the antiseptic is applied to). In addition to its above effects wormwood is also a prime ingredient in a very dangerous, very addictive drink called Absinthe which is milky green in color. X
