#### Yagdav Bush

Biome: Plains and Forests

A rather robust bush covered with waxy stiff leaves, the Yagdav is prominent in the north, and sometimes used as topiary decoration. During the warmer months the bush grows small yellow flowers. The flower petals are often dried and ground to make a tea that promotes fertility to couples that are having difficulty conceiving. The female is instructed to drink the tea every morning upon first awakening.

#### Yaran

Biome: Forests and Plains

The pollen of this flower must be inhaled. A successful roll means that a person’s sense of smell and of taste are doubled for one hour (advantage on perception checks for this period of time). The herb must still be growing or have been cut in the last 10 minutes.

#### Yarpick (Daggerthorn)

Biome: Forests and Jungles

A type of tree that grows small fruit whose seeds are nourishing both whole and as ground meal. The fruit are protected by long, thin, razor-sharp thorns approximately 3 inches long. These thorns have use as sewing needles, blow-darts, and as miniscule daggers perfect for doll hands.

#### Yarrow

Biome: Plains

The small white flowers of this herb, which cluster at the top of its one to two feet tall straight stem, should be crushed and applied to wounds. If successfully used it will stop minor bleeding, and reduce major bleeding to the minor level. A second application can then be used to stop the minor bleeding. According to legend Achilles used yarrow to treat wounded Greek troops during the Trojan War. The successful application of Yarrow grants an additional +4 to hit points regained during a short rest.

#### Yavethalion

Biome: Mountains and Plains

A small, groundcover shrub that sprouts tiny yellow flowers in spring which then turn to tiny yellow berries during summer months. 2d20 berries can be harvested from one plant. When the fruit is eaten, it will restore 1d4-1 hit points to the recipient. Yavethalion keeps for only two weeks.

#### Yazur

Biome: Jungles

Resembling a wild grape in tropical climates, yazur is a small purple berry that can be eaten outright, by anyone but a spellcaster, and tastes like sour apples. If a spellcaster eats yazur berries, the caster will lose a highest-level spell slot until the next long rest. Yazur can also be mashed into a paste with sugar. Applying this paste to any magic object will drain any magic abilities from it, and reverting the object to a normal, non-magical item in the process. If the paste is then eaten after absorbing this magic, it will heal the character to full hit points. In addition, the yazur plant can also be used against spellcasters in a tactical attack. When a spellcaster is directly injected with juice from the berries, all spells that the caster has memorized and prepared for the day will be obliterated from their memory.

#### Yew Tree

Biome: Forests

A tall, evergreen tree found in old growth forests, Yew have long been held sacred by druids as a symbol of death and rebirth, as dropping limbs of older trees will sometimes yield new sprouts. In addition, the yew has come to represent especially death since a poison can be prepared from yew needles and berries if soaked in oil under a full moon (3d6 poison damage to the recipient with no save).

#### Ylam Tree

Biome: Deserts

Found in many deserts, the Ylam Tree is a short, stout evergreen that survives on very little amounts of water and maintains its internal moisture using a thick red sap. Imbibing a sufficient quantity of this so-called 'Ylam Blood' or ‘Blood of Glory’ induces a frenzy of aggressive emotions which are especially strong in the heat of battle, leading to a berserk rage. Combatants under the influence of the blood of glory gain a +1 to hit and +2 to damage, but suffer a -3 penalty to armor class, due to the reckless abandon induced by the fluid for 2d6 hours after consumption.

#### Young Lad’s Love

Biome: Plains and Forests

Young Lad's Love is a 3 to 5-foot-tall shrub with many branches that resemble small trees. It has small yellow-white flowers, and green feathery leaves, which smell of lemon. These leaves turn a rich orange-brown in late autumn. The flowers should be crushed and placed into a poultice to be used. A successful application will cure one small area of frostbite, such as a foot or hand, in 2d4 hours.

#### Yuzine

Biome: Swamps and Rivers

A rare mushroom that only grows while fully submerged in freshwater, Yuzine is occasionally sought after and harvested by high ranking clergy of Omir and Olim, the Gods of Life and Death respectively. When powdered and combined with holy oil by a trained professional, Yuzine becomes Metabolite, a sort of tranquilizer for the undead. An undead creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. Lasting for 30 seconds on a failed save, an affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted. A creature affected by this poison makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it. On a failed save, the poison's saving throw DC for the next save attempt decreases by 10. Z
