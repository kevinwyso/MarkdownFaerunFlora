A leafy green plant that springs up in clusters, the majority of the plant is rather uninteresting, save for the violet flowers that seem to bloom almost year-round. When the wind blows through the flowers, their seeds rattle around inside and create a curious ringing sound, much like tiny bells. Many rural children enjoy picking them and weaving the flowers into their garments, which then jingle as they run and twirl. There is also a legend that the sound of the flowers ward off evil spirits, a legend that is partially true. Any fiend must make a DC 15 Wisdom save vs. fear in order to approach within 10 feet of the fairy bells or anyone wearing them.
