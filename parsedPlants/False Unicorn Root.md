A woody-stemmed flower with a large, white, cone-shaped flower that blooms from the top of the stalk. Very rare due to its slow growth and limited growing conditions, False Unicorn Horn has a rich history rooted in folklore. Supposedly, the root used to possess not only extremely beneficial healing properties, but extraordinary magic. This so angered some greater demons, that they sent an army of lesser demons to uproot and eat as many of the roots as they could, and this rage was so powerful that to this day the roots have not been able to fully grow back. The remaining tuberous stub is still imbued with good medicine and every spring it is able to put forth the tall spike of magic-imbued white flowers as a reminder that the power of good can always avert the forces of evil. (Consumption of this root will heal the recipient for 2d6+2 hit points, and make the individual invisible to demons and infernals for 1d4 hours.)
