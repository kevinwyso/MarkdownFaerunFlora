A wide-leafed plant with large pink flowers and thick roots containing a slimy gel. When the root is pulped, mixed with water and used as a poultice, it is effective against fresh burns, aiding rapid healing. The root-gel can also be thinned and drunk as a thick tea to counter the effects of blood loss. (Regains 1d8 hit points of fire damage if administered within 4 rounds of taking fire damage. If used to counter blood-loss, target can add 1d4 to the health regained from a short rest.)
