This strange looking, crescent-shaped nut grows from 30-ft tall leafy trees in tropical climates from long, thin filaments of nearinvisible silk. While the silk is sought after for use as fine embroidery thread, the nut can be boiled and reduced to a sticky, white paste. When applied to any item, this paste protects the item from acid, corrosion, and rust for 3d4 days.
