A deciduous tree with a flaky brown reddish bark, the trunk and limbs often grow to be gnarled and twisted. After peeling away the bark, the trees have a soft wood, which is harvested fresh to decrease nausea, and to numb the mouth. Orc shaman often harvest the wood to feed to expectant mothers. The small yellow, purple, and red flowers which bloom in the spring are crushed to make a heady, spicy perfume that many people claim is an aphrodisiac. The perfume grants a +1 bonus on Charisma (Persuasion) skill checks against men. A sack of the flowers can fetch anywhere from 5 to 30 gold pieces.
