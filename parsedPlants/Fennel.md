Fennel has thick stems, and bright green, lacy leaves and routinely grows to about five feet in height. (There is a rare form which has a bronze stem. In terms of its use, it is identical to the common fennel). In summer it has golden, yellow flowers. These flowers turn to seed in early Autumn. The seed heads must be harvested and left until the seeds separate from them. The seeds may then be mixed with boiling water to make a tea. This tea has the effect of relieving hunger in the recipient for 2d8 hours, However, it does not in any way act as a substitute for food, and any damage or exhaustion due to starvation will still occur. Any negative effects of exhaustion already being felt will evaporate for 1d8 hours. Aside from its common uses, Fennel is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.
