This herb grows to about 18 inches in height. It has many small white flowers. The flowers must be dried and then boiled in white wine and the resulting mixture must be drunk. This herb will remove the effects of vertigo from a person for up to twelve hours. It does this by stabilizing the persons inner ear. As a side-effect of stabilizing the inner ear, the herb also calms the fear centers of the brain, allowing for the recipient to overcome extreme fear for 2d6 hours (+3 to Wisdom Saves vs. fear).
