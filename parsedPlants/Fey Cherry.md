Somewhat rare, but unbelievably massive cherry trees that can live forever. Area under its canopy is mystically protected, i.e. always temperate and windspeeds are dampened by 20 mph. It blossoms annually but only creates cherries every 10 years, and eating a cherry picked less than a day ago grants a Protection from Good and Evil effect for 1d10 hours. In addition, if the cherry is mashed and given via mouth to a corpse, the fruit grants the effects of Gentle Repose for 10 days.
