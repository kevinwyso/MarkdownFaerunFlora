A highly invasive and virulent strain of poison ivy that seems to have some sort of sentient quality about them, often shifting slightly to trip up and ensnare unaware passersby. The small thorns on the ivy inject a small amount of poison many times into any creature unlucky enough to fall into the ivy. DC 15 Cons. Save. On a failed save, the ivy inflicts 3d6 poison damage and the target is poisoned. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and is not poisoned.
