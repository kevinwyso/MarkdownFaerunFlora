Growing only in very wet soil, this small, ivy-like ground vine will produce white flowers in the springtime that produce a fine pollen that causes the inhabitants of nearby towns to cover their faces for a week after the Spring Equinox. When inhaled, the character will forget everything he has experienced during the last 24 hours. There is a 10% chance he will remember everything when confronted with facts about those 24 hours. After three days the amnesia becomes permanent and there is no hope of recovery, and this day will be forever lost in the person’s mind. Some sinister organizations have started propagating Fjor’da in order to harvest this pollen for use in an inhaled poison called Silt Fjor’da (DC 18 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the recipient automatically forgets the last 24 hours with no possibility of recovery. On a successful save, the recipient has a 50% chance to recover the memories of the day).
