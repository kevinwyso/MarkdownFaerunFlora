A short plant with grey stalks and olive-colored hairy leaves, the Fleshwort thrives in areas where corpses lay. Often the plant will be seen on the site of battlefields, or where the dead were quickly buried. Some healers use the fibrous body of the Fleshwort to speed up the healing process (during a short rest, a character may add 1d6 to the total amount of hit points recovered).
