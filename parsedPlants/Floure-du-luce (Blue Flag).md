Floure-du-luce has broad and flat leaves shaped rather like a sword. The flowers are purplish-blue and faintly glow, and the roots, which tend to stretch themselves along the surface of the ground, are reddish brown on the outside. The root must be mashed and boiled and then left to stand for at least twenty days before drinking. The resulting tincture removes bruises and other external blemishes from a body very quickly (within 1d4 hours).
