This 30-cm high plant has 3 thick, fleshy leaves, dark green and covered with soft hairs. The light green blades that account for its height are actually bunches sheathes from which flower stalks grow during the summer covered in a waxy, protective coating. From each of the sheathes (there can be as many as 30 to a plant), a single flower stalk grows with tiny purple flowers. The thick leaves, which can become as large as 20 cm across, can be torn loose and put inside your boots (one leaf to a boot), enabling you to walk all day without tiring or even getting footsore (negating the need for a Forced March), as well as adding 5 to your movement speed until the next long rest, at which point, the flower must be replaced.
