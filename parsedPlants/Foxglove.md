A waist-height wildflower that typically sprouts several vertical columns of bell-shaped purple flowers in the late spring and early summer. The flowers are occasionally used in the treatment of heart conditions, but are also just as commonly used in the creation of poisons that will lead to death in a manner of a few days. After ingestion as a poison, the only cure is a greater restoration spell, or the person who ingested the foxglove will gain a level of incurable exhaustion every day as the targetâ€™s bodily functions begin to shut down.
