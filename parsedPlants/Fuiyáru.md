A ground-cover purple and dark green leafy plant that is distantly related to the Deadly Nightshade. When mashed and combined with water and filtered and then applied as drops to a creature's eyes, at the beginning of their next turn, the creature gains darkvision for 15 (3d10) minutes, and the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for the same length of time. This herb has no effect when used again to gain darkvision on the same creature until the creature completes a short rest.
