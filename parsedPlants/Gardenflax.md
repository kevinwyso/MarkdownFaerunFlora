The brown seeds of this herb (which has deep blue flowers), if chewed, remove all pain from a character’s wounds. It will also prevent a character from feeling any physical pain for 1d8 hours. The recipient could walk through a fire and feel no pain. There is a 50% chance per hour that a character moving normally will suffer 1d6 damage, while under the influence of this herb. This occurs because the character does not notice minor bruises or scratches. It was widely believed in medieval times that if the seeds of this plant were strewn across a vampire’s path the vampire would be unable to proceed further, until it had picked up and counted every seed. At the DM’s discretion this may be a use for this herb in campaigns.
