Gefnul will totally cure and heal the recipient if eaten within one week of harvesting. However, a 1d100 penalty roll must be made. A roll of over the recipientâ€™ hit points will automatically KO, putting the recipient into a death save scenario, and a roll of 100 will kill the recipient outright.
