Often found in clusters, these plants resemble brown leathery vases sitting on the ground with ragged leaves splayed out around the base where thick roots grasp the earth. The tops are open, and if one should peer inside the glint of their golden seeds can be seen in the interior. However, these plants are traps, and many explorer has come across the remains of smaller humanoids, their hands still clutching the golden seed pods. If someone is unwise enough to stick their hand within the pod, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or suffer 1d4 damage from the internal spines of the plant, and are then grappled. Their leathery surface has an Armor Class of 11, and to free a trapped arm 10 points of damage must be inflicted upon the plant. Ripping the plant out of the ground requires a Strength check, DC 20, and inflicts another 1d4 damage upon the trapped victim.
