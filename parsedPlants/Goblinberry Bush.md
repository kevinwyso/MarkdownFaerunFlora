Growing in high, desolate areas, the small bushes have dark green leaves that are nearly black, with silver undersides. The bushes sporadically sprout reddish-purple berries that have a strong sharp smell that often causes people to gag. Mixing the juice of the berries with a significant quantity of water and honey makes an interesting drink that is served sporadically in Evereska and Baldurâ€™s Gate. The juice can also be used as an astringent, if the patient can handle the smell.
