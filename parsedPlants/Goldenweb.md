A quick growing fungus that is often found spread between tree branches, it appears as a strange lattice similar to spiderwebs. Light shining through the strands causes them to subtly glow the color of gold, and the fungus has also been called “Goblin’s Greed”. While the strands of the fungus are slightly stronger than spiderwebs, they lack the stickiness that would cause them to impede or entangle creatures. The fungus works surprisingly well as an anticoagulant, and is quite absorbent. Healers often seek the fungus out when attempting to remedy injury poisons, and use of the fungus grants a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Medicine) skill checks when used in such a manner.
