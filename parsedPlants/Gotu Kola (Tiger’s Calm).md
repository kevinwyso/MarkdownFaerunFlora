A parsley like herb that grows low to the ground in warm, jungle environments. The herb gets its name because injured big cats have often been observed rolling around in Gotu Kola to heal their wounds from inter-species fights or from hunters. (The herb can be used to heal beasts, and only beasts for 1d8+3 hit points.)
