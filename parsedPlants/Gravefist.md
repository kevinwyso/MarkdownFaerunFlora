A pale white mushroom with five knobby protrusions, the mushroom often resembles a skeletal hand reaching upward. When the mushroom grows in clusters, it appears as if numerous corpses are attempting to reach out of the soil. The fungus predominantly grows in the Underdark; however, it has also been seen in dark basements and unused root cellars. Several tales of superstition follow the fungus, many believing that if it appears in rooms below your house, someone will soon die in the residence. This may be partially due to the fact that the mushrooms release toxic spores that slowly inflict 4d8 poison damage over 2d8 days to people that sleep or live within 100 feet of this fungus for that period of time.
