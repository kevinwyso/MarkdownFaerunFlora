These dark violet flowers are often found at the edges of graveyards and sites of massive battles. Those that tend gravesites often call them “Death Trumpets” for their shape, and they emit a smell similar to that of a corpse. Thus, when such flowers are noticed, they are often pulled up by the root, to remove such an unpleasant odor. However, despite their terrible odor, it is believed by followers of Kelemvor and Bane that should you die with the seeds of this plant in your possession, your spirit will find an easier path to the afterlife. Thus, many keep the seeds of such a flower in a cloth bag close to their chest. Unfortunately for others, this means that the flowers often sprout from the corpse several days after the death of such individuals.
