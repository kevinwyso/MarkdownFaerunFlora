biome: Swamps

Growing in the swamps, the plant appears to be little more than a pair of large, broad leaves floating on the surface of the stagnant water. During warmer months, a large yellow flower blossoms in the midst of the two leaves. Hidden beneath the surface, the plant has an extensive root system that reaches far down into the muck in a massive tangle that catches debris carried along by the slow current. Various species of fish and snakes lay their eggs in the tangle of roots. Various orc tribes harvest the Guklulla for the roots, pulling the plants out of the muck, cutting off sections of the roots and throwing them back into the swamp to be harvested again in the future. Grinding the root into a paste and applying it to wounds provides not only accelerated healing (+4 when using hit dice during a short rest. If the recipient of the healing is an orc or half-orc, they receive an additional 1d4 hit points.), but also numbs the affected area.
