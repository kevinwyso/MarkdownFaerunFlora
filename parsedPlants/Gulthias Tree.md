biome: Forests and Jungles

A severely evil tree that came to be when a vampire was staked to the ground with a stake that was still green and took root. Undead typically flock to the singular tree located somewhere in a dark corner of the largest forest of Faerun, and seem to gain some form of power from it. (Can be used as a storypoint or worldbuilder for DMâ€™s).
