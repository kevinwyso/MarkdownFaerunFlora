In the highland meadows of the Dalelands grows a pale white-silver crocus. By starlight, nectar can be harvested from its simple bloom and dried into snuff that engulfs the user in bittersweet recollections of yore. With each dose of the Halcyon Snuff the user remembers a spell forgotten, effectively allowing him or her to cast it again without expending a spell slot. However, other memories linger uninvited to forever haunt and burden the user of this drug. Each dose inflicts 2d6 o psychic damage after the initial effect.
