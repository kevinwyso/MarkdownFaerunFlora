Stems of bright green hold jagged leaves that grow in clusters of three. The plant grows delicate yellow flowers that smell pleasant, with the smell often drifting in the breeze on warm summer nights. The golden flowers that blossom from the plant grow to resemble a pair of hands pressed together. A common belief is that the flower resembled the hands of Laretha, a young cleric of Tymora, while she prayed to the gods to save her from misfortune at the hands of a horde of bandits. Her prayers were answered by the arrival of a group of adventurers. Afterward the flowers appeared near her shrine, a sign that the goddess was looking over her. Commonly used by paladins and clerics, the flowers grant a +3 to any religion checks when worn as a crown or behind the ear.
