A multi-colored flower ranging between yellow and purple and everywhere in between with several strands of fiber attached to the petals across the empty space in the center of the flower. A few decades ago, an herbalist found that strumming the fibers would hold a tune, and since then, the flowers have become a common gift for friends and loved ones. Some talented herbalists have learned to breed the Harlequinâ€™s Harps in a way that the fibers can be tuned to specific notes for personalized gifts.
