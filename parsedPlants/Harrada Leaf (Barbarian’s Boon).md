A green, leafy plant whose leaves are tinged with a deep purple. The leaves are commonly dried and smoked or cultivated and harvested for this purpose by criminal organizations. Although highly addictive, Harrada Leaf is used to grant a huge boon to a person’s physical strength at the cost of intelligence and common sense. After consumption, Harrada Leaf will grant a +4 bonus to the Strength skill at the cost of -3 to both Wisdom and Intelligence (not reducing either of these stats to less than zero) for a period of 1d4-1 hours. After this period is up (with the exception of rolling a 1-1) the user will have to make a DC 18 Cons. Save or be poisoned by the drug’s after-effects, which will instill a -3 penalty to strength and a -1 penalty to both Wisdom and Intelligence until the next dosage is consumed.
