This odd bush grows in deep forests, where men often fear to tread because of dark and wild fey creatures. The bush grows strong curved branches that resemble the antlers of a deer, and in their center, they grow a single purple flower. Legend has it that the plant was originally created to help combat the Unseelie fey, ages ago. However, through trickery and guile, the dark fey managed to destroy many of the plants not in their possession, or not hidden deep within their realms. The flower can be consumed for two main purposes: often sought out by those undertaking a vow of celibacy, consumption of the flower reduces libido for 2d6 days. In addition, the consumption of the flower hides the recipient from being tracked by fey for the same period of time.
