A bright, crimson-red flower atop an impossibly thin green stalk. Typically blooming in late spring, or early summer, the flower then begins to change color with the dayâ€™s progress, going from red to midnight blue as it becomes night. Preparation of the flower as a tea will allow the recipient to stay awake for 3 days at a time, being able to function normally and accomplish minor tasks during a long rest. After these three days, the recipient will then fall into a magical sleep resembling the spell Feign Death. The target will wake up after 8 hours, but for all intents and purposes will appear dead.
