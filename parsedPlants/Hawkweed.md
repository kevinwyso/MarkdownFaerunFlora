Hawkweed has oval leaves, covered with small hairs on the underside, and green on the top. These leaves surround the plant at the base of the stem, and small yellow flowers tinged with red at the tips. This herb increases a character eyesight for 1d4 hours. They can see twice as far, granting +3 on perception checks involving sight, and when in ballistic combat, all ranges are treated as if 30 feet less.
