A fairly common flowering shrub with purple flowers that produces small berries in warm spring months. Heather was once used by the singular village of Brookstead to create a spectacularly rare and wonderfully tasting heather mead. The village was pillaged and plundered by a rogue sect of dwarves and the few survivors were hounded for their recipe. For the most part, the villagers did not part with their recipe and the secret of heather mead is now lost to the ages. Whether or not any survivors went on to make more is still a mystery, but every now and then, a bottle of heather mead will pop up in a small, far-off market, fetching an exorbitant price.
