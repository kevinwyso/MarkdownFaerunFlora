A vine-like shrub, often growing in remote and desolate locations, the shrub has dark green leaves, and sprouts indigo colored berries. The shrub is named due to long black thorns that protect the plant from various foraging animals. The berries are often harvested to be eaten, or can be fermented to make Helmthorn Wine. On occasion a plant will produce red berries, which are seen as a symbol of good luck, and make a slightly sweeter vintage of wine. The wine is considered sacred to many practicing clerics (capable of restoring an expended spell slot for a cleric that consumes the wine) and the berries can be used with the spell Goodberry, and these berries will instead restore 2 hit points per berry and last for an additional day.
