A large, woody, flowering shrub, the hidden hibiscus grows from 6' to 8' high, and as much as 10' wide. The blooms of the hibiscus are large (easily the size of a human hand), plentiful, and many colored. Bloom colors are typically red with yellow ribs, or pink with dark red ribs, but some sages claim there are thousands of different color combinations and variations. If a Hidden Hibiscus is threatened, or detects rapid movement nearby, any blooms on the bush immediately change their color to drab greens and browns, and the entire plant appears to wilt and wither. Skilled alchemists use the roots of the Hidden Hibiscus to amplify their creations that aid in natural camouflage (adding wilted hidden hibiscus to armor will negate any stealth penalties that the armor normally has), but the blooms of the hibiscus are its true prize as they can be used to dramatically increase both physical and mental speed for short periods of time (+2 bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence stats for 1d4+1 hours). Only brightly colored blooms can be used in these speed-increasing concoctions, and once a Hidden Hibiscus changes the color of one of its blooms, they never change back.
