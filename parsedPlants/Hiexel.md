This tree has silvery-green bark covering a sparse collection of branches which curve upward to support vibrantly green leaves which turn dark red in autumn. The wood is an odd hue of green, and unfortunately not dense enough to be useful in construction. However, burning the wood creates a large quantity of smoke, which is often used to smoke meat or to create signal fires (or to create clouds of smoke that can be used for escape and distraction). The bark is useful after rendering it down to create a thick green paste which is often sought after to seal buildings against the cold winds of winter.
