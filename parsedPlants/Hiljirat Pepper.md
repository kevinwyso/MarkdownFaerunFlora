A small plant that has many branches, each which end in a single triangular leaf, the peppers that also grow on the plant are much sought after for their spice. The peppers are either dried or ground into powder after being picked, allowing them to be shipped afar with little chance of spoilage. The wealthy of the cities of the Sword Coast enjoy the taste of the peppers, and several sailing merchants pay exorbitant amounts to have the peppers harvested and shipped.
