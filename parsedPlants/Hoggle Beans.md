A single leafy stalk with a tough exterior that grows in gentle rolling fields of the Dalelands, the plant produces numerous pods upon reaching maturity. Within each pod are small pink beans, each one almost perfectly spherical. Most large herbivores, such as cattle and goats, avoid the plant, as it has a detrimental effect. Herbalists and healers often seek the plant out because the beans are a strong laxative, requiring a DC 15 Consitution saving throw after being ingested to avoid the unpleasant effects.
