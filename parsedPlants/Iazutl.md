Growing in clusters, the flower has a long stalk, which has a single oval leaf at the very top of the plant. The leaf points toward the rising sun, and blows in anything more than a light breeze. During warmer months, the plant blossoms numerous small crimson flowers. Those that venerate Kiltzi speak tales of the Iazutl flower. One tale speaks of the plant growing singularly, and without flowers, and when Kiltzi noticed the plant was all alone, she wept. Her tears caused several similar plants to grow in the area, and as an expression of their love for her, they sprouted an abundance of flowers. Lovers often gift the flowers to one another, as a sign of their affection. The flowers are also typically presented to the bride by the groom on the night before the wedding in Sword Coast wedding ceremonies.
