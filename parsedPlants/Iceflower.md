A short plant, the stalk bears a number of feathery leaves, and a single flower blooms, bearing shades of blue. The plant is only seen in areas of abundant snow, and oddly seems to thrive where other plants would perish. The plant is only seen during the summer months, when there is considerable sunlight, and in winter months it withers and dies. Beneath the surface of the snow, the iceflower has an extensive root system that grows very quickly. The roots are durable enough that some of the northern tribes will dig them up to serve as a foundation for a roof over small circular huts. In addition, some nomadic tribes of the Dalelands have found that by placing iceflower roots under the armor, soldiers have found that they will be immune to overheating and gain +1 AC.
