Trees, commonly used in wand and magestaff construction, that grow upwards of 100 feet tall. Although the trees can grow incredibly large, their branches are relatively close to the ground, hanging a mere 30 feet from the forest floor. Their leaves are fanshaped and about a foot in length, while their bark is reddishbrown speckled with gray. The wood is not as hard or as strong as coldwood, bronzewood, or oak, but it is suitable for delicate furnishings.
