This 2-foot-high plant has dark blue leaves with a thick white hair growth on the underside. It grows all summer and the first half of autumn, and has many small yellow 6 leaved flowers. The plant has a milky white sap, which can be rubbed onto the skin, hardening it and granting a +1 AC bonus for one hour. Repeated and frequent use will cause the skin to lose some of its natural elasticity and cause a -1 AC penalty (after use of Ironhard 5 times within 1 week).
