biome: Jungles

Tenacious and ugly root-plant native to jungle environs that looks like a pocked, skeletal hand. These pock-marks are actually small holes that cause a low hissing sound, caused by the plantâ€™s ability to capture wind in these holes, audible to 100 ft (DC 15 listen to notice sound and direction) that imposes a -4 penalty to other listen checks (for the party and against the party). If kept wrapped in moist cloth it survives for 1 week, but DC 18 Nature check can keep it alive for another week.
