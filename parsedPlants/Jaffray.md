A clove-like herb that is normally ground up and sprinkled into other dishes or drinks as flavoring, Jaffray acts as a mild aphrodisiac, increasing sexual interest and general sensitivity to the surroundings. Face flushes, pupils dilate, breathing quickens, and skin becomes preternaturally sensitive. The herb has a mildly cinnamon-like flavor and its potency is not affected by being cooked. The herb is also sometimes used to counteract suspected poisoning, since it increases resistance to poison yet is so common as to be inoffensive if added to a meal. (-2 to Wisdom checks, +2 to Constitution Saves, +1 to Persuasion checks, causes mild, pleasant sense of intoxication. Effects last 1d4 hours.)
