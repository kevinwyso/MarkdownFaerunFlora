A light violet vine that grows around trees, and can often be found amidst ruins. The vine produces large, heart shaped petals, and purple flowers with five petals. Young women often pick the flowers to wear in their hair, and several religious ceremonies require a carpet of jalap flowers. Shaman often use a poultice made of ground jalap to draw the venom out of venomous snake bites. Application of the poultice grants an additional saving throw against the poisoning effects of many types of snake venom.
