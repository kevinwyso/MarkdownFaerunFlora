It is said that when a representative of the Martel Company brought the first samples of Jelly Moss back to Banuvo's College of Mysteries, it nearly caused a riot among the academics. The resident sages were unable to conclusively determine if this clump of grayish-purple tube-like structures, smelling a bit like rotten pears, was a plant or a fungus. It was known that Jelly Moss, when crushed, becomes very messy and sticky, but until an unlucky professor sat a small sample of Jelly Moss thatâ€™d been left on his chair, no one had realized this goo would create an almost instant, permanent, bond of incredible strength with wood. The battle of classification rapidly transformed into a full-blown war between the Blacksmith's Guild and the Carpenters over the future of nails.
