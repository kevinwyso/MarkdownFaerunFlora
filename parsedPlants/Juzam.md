A hardy desert cactus that can grow to heights of up to 15 feet. Around the base of the cactus, a ring of pink flowers grows yearround, with flowers only growing back after a full year without rain. These flowers turn into a small, hard, pink fruit that can be harvested (only 1 harvested from a single plant) and juiced to yield a potion that heals for 3d6+3 hit points. K
