A short leafy stalk that grows fine red hairs along the prominent bud, it is often mistaken for the taller Dragonâ€™s Breath. Those well versed in herbalism also know that the weed can be used to create a balm which soothes sunburn, and helps alleviate the pain from other burns (if applied within 2 turns of taking fire damage, capable of healing 2d4 fire damage). Many seeking to traverse the desert of Netheril often procure quanities of the balm before setting out on their journeys, and the Bedine tribes often make use of the soothing qualities of the weed.
