A short plant that grows in tendrils across the ground sprouting broad fluffy leaves, the Kanishta thrives in the cold environment. Growing beneath the ground is a thick, dark-colored root. Although it is extremely bitter tasting, chewing on the root provides temporary relief from the cold weather. Those that chew it express a feeling of warmth passing through their body, and a sense of renewed strength (resistance to cold/frost damage, and +1 to Str. Checks for the next 1d6 hours).
