Growing in deep ravines and shadowy places of the desert, the brambles grow along the ground, rarely achieving waist height. The stems are covered in long, spiny thorns, and the plant grows wide leaves close to the ground. In the cooler months the plant blossoms with flowers of various colors. The leaves, once dried, are often smoked by nomadic tribes during religious rituals. The dried leaves are rolled together and lit, or used as incense. Those that inhale the smoke have auditory hallucinations, often of imperceptible whispers, although some are capable of discerning what is being said and declare that it is the voice of the divines giving them directions.
