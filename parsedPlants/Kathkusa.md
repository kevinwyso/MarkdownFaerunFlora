This plant is found only in the most inhospitable regions. When a leaf of the plant is eaten, it will (if used successfully) raise a personâ€™s strength +2 for 1d10 rounds. However, if the nature check is failed by more than three, the plant was prepared incorrectly, and the person will collapse into unconsciousness for one hour.
