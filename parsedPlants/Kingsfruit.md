The bark of this tree is smooth, and a rich brown in color while the soft leaves are oval shaped and grow in small clusters. During the warmer months, small violet flowers grow from the tree. During the autumn months, the tree produces a dark brown fruit with a tough exterior. The fruit has an extremely hard rind, and require a blow from a hammer to open. Striking either end of the fruit causes the rind to cleanly split into six equal parts. The inside of the fruit is a shade of golden yellow, and is quite sweet. Eating the fruit restores hit points equal to two of your hit dice and restores any hit dice expended from short rests.
