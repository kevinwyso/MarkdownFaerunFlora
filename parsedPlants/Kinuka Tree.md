The twisting trunk sprouts many long branches that reach out to other trees to form a thick canopy. During most of the year, the tree bears a multitude of feathery red leaves that turn purple in the fall. In the spring the tree is punctuated by small clusters of white flowers. The flowers are said to carry luck with them, and many young women hoping to become brides wear them in their hair.
