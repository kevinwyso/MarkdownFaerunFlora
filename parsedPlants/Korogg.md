Korogg is a rare underdark fungus that typically grows on the corpses of dead miners and dwarves who aren’t properly buried. Black, bulbous bodies with fine black mycelia produce a fungal fruit called Korogg Pods, which can then be reduced to their juice and distilled. This rich liquor is sought after for its taste and smell. When a character imbibes Korogg Liquor, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save. The liquor quells freethinking: no person who drinks it need make an Investigation check while under its influence for the duration of a day, as the result will incur a -8 penalty since they can’t think of anything their investigation might mean, and the consumer takes a -1d6 penalty to wisdom checks after consumption until the next long rest.
