Growing off of tree branches, at first inspection this fungus appears to be the cocoon of an insect. The fungus is intrusive, sending tendrils into the tree branches and stealing water reserves. Sporadically another pod will emerge from the tree branch, swell to the size of a human fist, and then burst, sending a cloud of black spores floating on the wind. The spores are a severe irritant and may even cause temporary blindness if a large mass of spores get into the eyes of a creature (DC 12 Constitution Save if within 15 feet of the tree). The pods are also sought after for food, as frying them in oil and serving them with fish is a delicacy served in Waterdeep.
