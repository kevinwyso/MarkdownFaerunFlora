Parsley-like herb descended from plants growing on the shores of large rivers and oceans. If crushed and rubbed onto meat, that meat never dries out regardless of how overcooked. If used as a component for casting Gentle Repose, it doubles the duration (does not stack with extend spell). Matures in 14 weeks and remains viable for 5 weeks after.
