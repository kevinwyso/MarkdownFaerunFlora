A spiky groundcover plant avoided by beasts because of the small, thin thorns that sprout from the plants that, with enough force, become embedded in an animalâ€™s paws. The leaves can be carefully harvested and crushed into a poultice. If applied to a venomous bite or injury poison within one turn, it will draw out the poison, healing 1d4 poison damage and removing the poisoned effect if applicable.
