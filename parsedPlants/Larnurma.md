This tree has round purple fruit, which are about the size and consistency of plums. When eaten this fruit will heal 2 hp per fruit. These fruits cannot be dried and will rot within two weeks of picking. However, the juice of three fruits can be mixed with olive (or other vegetable) oil, and left to stand for a week. This oil has an almost unlimited life. Rubbing this oil into the recipientâ€™s skin will ease muscle pains, and also restore 1d4 hit points, but may only be used once per short rest to utilize these effects.
