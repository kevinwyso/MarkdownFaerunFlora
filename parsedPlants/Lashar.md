A grey, slightly slimy lichen that grows on rocks in the middle of streams. When ground up into a slurry and consumed, it will slow the effects of poison for 2 hours, resulting in half damage taken from poisons in that time and putting off the poisoned effect until the slurry works its way through the body. After that the poison will resolve normally, unless another potion is drunk. The slimy concoction is very repulsive, and a DC 14 Constitution saving throw is needed to see if the imbiber can actually hold it down.
