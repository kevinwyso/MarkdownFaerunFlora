A squat evergreen tree with dusty green bark, and olive-green needles that grow in clusters, most people avoid burning the wood of the tree. Setting the wood ablaze resulted in a large number of sparks, which potentially could set houses ablaze, due to the high amount of pitch contained within the wood. The needles, which grow in “shags” at the end of each branch, are often used in special torches which burn for 2 hours. The needles are also often burned simply for the deep piney aroma they provide.
