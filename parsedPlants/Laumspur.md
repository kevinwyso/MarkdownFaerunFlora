A deep green plant with small red flower on a singular stalk, Laumspur is renowned for its healing properties. These flowers can be eaten fresh or dried for later use. If not dried they will become useless within 1 week. The flowers can also be brewed over a very low heat in fresh water to produce a tea-like potion, which can be drunk for its healing effect. When consumed, the herb will, on a successful check, heal 6 hit points with fresh leaves, 4 hit points using dry leaves, and 1d8+2 hit points using the brew.
