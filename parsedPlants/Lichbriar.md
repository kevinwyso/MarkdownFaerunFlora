It has incredibly poisonous thorns (DC 14 Constitution Save or take -1 to Str. and - 1 to Dex. until cured) and subsists by growing roots into living creatures and slowly draining their hit points and experience until they die (If a character were to fall unconscious by any means within 5 feet of Lichbriar, they must then make a DC 14 Str. Save to get out of the rapidly growing briars after they awaken. -5 hit points for every hour unconscious).
