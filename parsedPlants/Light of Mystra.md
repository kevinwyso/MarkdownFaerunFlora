biome: Underdark/Caves

Small mushrooms with thick heads; the outer skin is a pale blue color, and the head is often covered in small off-color bumps. In the darkness the mushrooms glow, attracting creatures to consume the fungus. Within the bumps of the cap, the mushroom holds a dense collection of spores. After digesting and passing the mushroom, the spores begin to sprout. The glow of the mushrooms is slightly magical, and casting Detect Magic reveals a pale aura of illusion magic, illusion that causes people to believe that theyâ€™re much tastier than they actually are. Some say that the mushroom was blessed by Mystra, to help her followers find their way out of the Underdark.
