A broad-leafed medium height tree that produces yellow flowers in early spring and long, flat seed-pods in mid to late summer. The tree has long been considered an object of worship since the linden was associated with Freya, the guardian of life and goddess of fortune, love, and fertility. Therefore, her tree was considered a tree of peace and it often formed the central meeting place of many villages and rural communities. Furthermore, legend has it that it cannot be struck by lightning since Freya is the wife of Wodan, the god of lightning and thunder.
