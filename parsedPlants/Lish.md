Small tree, which grows dozens of small nuts in the spring in temperate forests. A handful of the nuts sustains a medium creature for a day. Eating a Lish Nut as a full-round action provides limited protection from vermin of size medium or smaller, which must succeed a DC 11 Constitution save or become violently ill for 2d4 rounds due to the odor of the Lish Nut coming from the consumerâ€™s skin. The affected creatures have disadvantage on all checks, saves, and rolls to hit while in the presence of someone who has recently eaten a Lish Nut, and an additional -3 to rolls that would directly impact the consumer.
