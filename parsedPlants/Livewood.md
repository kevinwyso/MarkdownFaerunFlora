Highly magical green-colored tree native to Elven Forests of Faerun whose wood remains alive when felled. Items made from it are affected by Plant Growth, sprouting small branches and leaves, while Speak with Plants allows one to communicate with them and Blight damages them as if they were plant creatures. Livewood items can also be used for Tree Stride, Animate Plants can animate a Livewood object, and Dryads can live in Livewood objects. As a living object, a Livewood items are immune to the Disintegrate spell. Crafting items made from Livewood requires special training from a druid or dryad, and a successful nature check.
