A hardy vine that grows easily in the nooks and crannies of brick and mortar structures and can often be found in older cities or in ruins. The vine rapidly grows along the crevasses provided by mortar, and every few feet a small yellow flower sprouts from the vine, surrounded by a handful of apparently errant tendrils. These flowers smell very faintly like rotting meat, which is used to attract vermin such as small lizards and rats. When the vermin begin to eat the flower, the tendrils quickly close around the creature, slowly constricting and choking the life from the creature. This feature causes many urban dwelling folks to not only tolerate the presence of the vine, but to also encourage such growth.
