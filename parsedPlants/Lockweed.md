A tufty grass that grows in large expanses on the sides of brackish water or stagnant ponds, that when harvested and chewed, provides some numbness to the mouth and throat, making the plant commonly used as an oral analgesic for toothaches or sore throats. However, when distilled and refined, Lockweed also becomes a mild paralytic agent. creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature's jaw muscles lock and its tongue becomes numb. An affected creature cannot speak or cast spells that require verbal components for 10 minutes. On a successful save, the target experiences the typical analgesic effects of Lockweed.
