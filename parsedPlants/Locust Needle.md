A short stubby tree covered in long thorns, the bark is a light brown, and the leaves are a vibrant green tinged with gold. The leaves of the plant are quite edible and known to help prevent scurvy. Some pirate crews use the trunks of the tree to make crude morning-stars, while others harvest the thorns to use as improvised tattoo needles that add small amounts of gold flecks to the resulting tattoos.
