Found only in forests where some trees exceed 300 years of age. The small shrub yields a limited number of yellow, plum sized berries (1d3 berries harvested from a single bush) that can be mashed into the hand of a druid. If the druid then touches the tree with this hand he or she is able drain a portion of life force from a tree. Each tree has 3d4hp for each 50 years it has lived. The drained life force will then be added to his own. Do not drain more than 50% of life force from a tree, it will kill the tree, and this will anger the fey of the forest.
