Wound-powder drug, made from stalks of Abyssal plants. Initial +1 bonus to all ability scores along with intense pain for 1d8 minutes. Second use grants a +2 bonus to all ability scores and excruciating pain that causes disadvantage on checks and saves of all kinds for 2d8 minutes. Third use causes the possibility of addiction (DC 20 Constitution Save) and a -3 to all ability scores and pain that renders the user incapable of doing anything and lowers movement speed to 1 foot for 3d8 hours. As long as the user is addicted and does not have access to more Luhix, they will take a -5 penalty to all checks and movement speed will be halved as they are too lethargic to do anything of importance.
