A yellow, glowing mushroom that takes a few months to grow to maturity, begins to spread spore powder, and then dies after a week to start the process over. Many Herbalists keep the glowing mushrooms themselves in dark cellars in order to harvest this dust every chance they can, as this powder can be used to concoct a Potion of Heroism.
