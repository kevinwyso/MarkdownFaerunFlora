This plant has broad leaves covered with dark spots, resembling diseased lungs. Ironically enough, the plant is used in the treatment of disease infected lungs, by steeping the leaves in boiling water, an infusion can be created called Lucialung. A successful treatment renders easier breathing and clears fluids from the lungs that could be caused by a whole array of diseases - pneumonia and tuberculosis to name but two. It does not actually cure the disease, but merely relieves the symptoms. With some diseases that alone can be the difference between life and death.
