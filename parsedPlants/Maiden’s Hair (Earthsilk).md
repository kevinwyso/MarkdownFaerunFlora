An odd mushroom cultivated by dwarves for the silken tendrils that hang from it and collect moisture. These tendrils are tough and time-consuming to harvest, but they can be made into a very tough silk that can then be made into tough rope and shirts or woven into existing armor that then grants extra resistance to bludgeoning and slashing, although the fabric can be torn by a piercing damage critical hit, at which point it loses its properties until repaired. Crafting with Maidenâ€™s Hair requires a DC Nature Check of 25+ or consultation with a Dwarven master craftsman.
