A feathery, light brown mushroom, found growing wild in forests and very difficult to cultivate. The maitake is a mild, tasty mushroom, and can be used to increase immune efficacy. The word maitake is literally translated as "dancing mushroom." According to herbal folklore, it was so named because in ancient times people who found maitake could exchange it for its weight in silver, leading to their dancing in celebration.
