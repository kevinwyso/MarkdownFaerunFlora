This herb works very rapidly against damage poisons from common pests including snakes, spiders, and scorpions, quickly running through the body and absorbing any left-over poison from the blood if applied within 2 rounds of being poisoned. Removes the poison effect but does not heal for any of the damage the poison has actually done.
