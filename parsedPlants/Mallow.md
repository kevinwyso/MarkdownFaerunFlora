A tall plant with many star shaped leaves sprouting from the main stalk, the mallow plant is notable for the large five petal white flowers. Several tribes of nomadic people use the flowers for decoration, especially during fertility ceremonies. The Azuposi people brew a tea from the plant, said to ward away any “evil spirits” (Those that drink the tea gain Advantage on any saving throw meant to resist mind control or possession until the next short rest).
