A tiny sprouting ground plant that produces a singular golden, bell-shaped flower in the late summer. After crushing this flower and inhaling the subsequent pollen that erupts, which smells slightly of sour apple, the recipient must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is affected for 10 minutes as if the spell Suggestion was cast on them, meaning that they will accomplish simple tasks if even hinted at.
