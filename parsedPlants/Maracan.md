Resembling a dead wood shrub, Maraca subsists off of magical energy found within the earth and therefore does not grow leaves, and the slightest amount of water will drown it. Branches of maraca can be snapped off, dried, and grated under the light of a full moon into a fine powder that faintly glows. When a dose of the dust is thrown on a target, it will negate the saving throws for the next spell on him. An attack roll must be made against unwilling targets that know that the caster is up to something. This powder is also known as magedust and can fetch pretty hefty prices at market.
