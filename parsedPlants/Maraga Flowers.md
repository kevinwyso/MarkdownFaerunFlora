Growing as a small bush with broad, heart shaped leaves, the plant also grows vibrant red-and-violet flowers. The bush also emits an enticing scent that almost overpowers the smell of the plantâ€™s decaying prey. The insides of the flowers are lined with a number of sharp thorns, and each flower is capable of spraying a paralytic poison at potential prey (DC 15 Cons. Save if within 5 feet of the plant or suffer 3d6 poison damage. If the target creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they are Paralyzed for 1d4 hours). Once the prey falls to the ground, the bush is capable of slowly moving due to having shallow roots, and entangling the paralyzed creature. The root system slowly crushes the prey, and the bush feeds upon the nutrients as the body decays.
