A small, gnarled tree found in temperate plain environments with bright pink leaves, the leaves are commonly ground into a drug well-known amongst spellcasters called Memory Dust. Taken as a snuff, the dust gives a magic-user the ability to memorize and cast a single spell of the level above his normal maximum (for example, a 1st level magic-user could memorize and gain a slot for a single 2nd level spell) until the next long rest. The dust is highly addictive. After every session in which a magic-user has made use of the dust, he must make a Wis. check on 1d20. If the roll results in a number higher than his Wis. score, the character will do everything he can to use the dust again in the next session, paying sometimes exorbitant prices. A roll of 20 indicates that the character's tolerance for the dust has increased, and from now on he must consume twice the quantity to achieve the same effect.
