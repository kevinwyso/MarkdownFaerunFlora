biome: Swamps

Lurking beneath the stagnant water of swamps across the realm waits a plant made of veiny tendrils looking to fill a spine-filled maw. When unsuspecting prey wanders nearby, the tendrils snake around flailing limbs, dragging it into the maw. The plant slowly submerges back beneath the surface, crushing the prey caught within its grasp. The Marsh Maw is a danger that dwells within shallow swamps, using the brackish water as camouflage. The plant has a deep root system that goes deep, holding the monstrosity in place. The Maw often lurks at the edges of the swamp, near where herd animals come to drink. More than a few unlucky shepherds have lost members of their flock to the danger that lurks just beneath the surface.
