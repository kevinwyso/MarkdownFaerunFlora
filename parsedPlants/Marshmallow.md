This plant has a green fleshy stem and broad egg-shaped leaves, both of which are covered with downy hairs. It has five-petalled, pale pink flowers which sit at the base of the leaves. The root must be boiled, and the resultant distillation applied to burns. If used successfully the herb will double the rate of healing for the burn, granting one half hit point for every point of fire damage being treated.
