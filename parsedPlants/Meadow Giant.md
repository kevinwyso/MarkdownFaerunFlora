Tenacious, large green-stemmed weed that can spring up overnight in temperate grasslands, plains and farmlands. It easily threatens crops, and its powdered stem can be made into an anticoagulant called White Sanguine, which when added to an injury poison, causes the victim to bleed for 1 point of damage each round for one minute if it fails a DC 15 Constitution save against the poison. Magical healing or a DC 15 Medicine check stops the bleeding.
