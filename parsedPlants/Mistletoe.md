Mistletoe is a parasitic evergreen shrub that grows mostly in copses of other evergreens. Mistletoe has long been a sacred herb to druids, and branches of mistletoe have been hung from the ceilings to ward off evil spirits for centuries. The origin of kissing under the mistletoe comes from an age-old story of the deities, that Eldath, the goddess of peace was nearly slain with an arrow made of a mistletoe branch. When she was revived from the brink of death, the mistletoe was then turned over to the domain of Sune, the goddess of love and she vowed that whenever anyone passed under a branch of mistletoe they would kiss to illustrate that mistletoe had become a symbol of love and not of hate.
