This full body bush grows a plentiful amount of waxy green leaves, that turn pink in the fall. During warmer months the bush sprouts flowers of yellow and orange, which turn into sweet little berries. The leaves and berries of the bush can be harvested and rendered down to create a waxy resin that is often used to seal the hulls of seagoing boats, replacing pitch. The practice is far from common, as the process to create the resin is far more expensive than using the traditional methods. Some seamstresses also coat their threads in the resin, which allows for the creation of finer garments. These garments represent armored fine clothing, the appearance of fine clothes with the protection of light armor (AC 11+Dexterity Mod).
