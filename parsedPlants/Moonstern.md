A glowing silver mushroom that can be found in caves at least 500 feet below surface-level. The mushroom can be ground and combined with pure alcohol to create a magically enchanted secret ink. Two doses are needed for a full vial of ink. This ink is only readable in unobstructed moonlight. During day time, the ink reads as magically shifting, incomrephensible silver runes.
