A brown, rapidly growing bramble that rapidly encroaches on small areas, smothering other plants. The roots of the bramble are woody and taste slightly like sassafras. After ingesting the roots raw or in an infusion, the creature takes 10 (2d10) necrotic damage and gains resistance to poison damage for the same number of minutes.
