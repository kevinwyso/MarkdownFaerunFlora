Mother’s Worry very closely resembles the plant Mother’s Mercy except for the presence of the small, white blooms that are present on Mother’s Mercy during the late spring and early summer. A tall, woody-stemmed plant that when broken releases copious amounts of a thin, milky fluid. By harvesting this liquid and evaporating away the excess water, Mother’s Worry can be turned into a mild poison that causes the rapid onset of unconsciousness via constriction of the airways. Upon ingestion, the recipient must make a DC 12 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 poison damage and falls unconscious for 1d6 hours. On a successful save, the target instead takes only one half of the poison damage with no secondary effect.
