biome: Underdark/Caves

A strange plant that grows in the Underdark, the stalk of the plant is a shade of grey similar to ashes. The few leaves that sprout from the stalk are a lighter shade of grey with dark veins running through them. Every few hours the flowers of the plant open, and appear very similar to white moths. When the flowers are open, the plant emits a strange smell which causes goblinoids to retch. Any goblinoid (including Kobolds, Goblins, Bugbears, and Hobgoblins) approaching within 20 feet of the plant must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become nauseous. Flowers that have been picked do not confer the same effect.
