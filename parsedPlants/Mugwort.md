Mugwort can grow to be taller than a man. It has a stiff and angular stem, reddish brown in color. It has deeply incised smooth leaves which are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. It has small, yellow-green or yellow-red flowers arranged in long spikes at the top of the stem. The effects of this herb last for two hours; the leaves are harvested and then smoked. During this time the character is granted +20 temporary hit points, and can function normally even while at exhaustion of up to level 5. If used more than one time, the user must make a DC 25 Constitution Save or become addicted. While addicted, the consumer loses 5 hit points per hour and has disadvantage on all checks and saves. Aside from its common uses, Mugwort is the rarest of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.
