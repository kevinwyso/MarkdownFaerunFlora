A waterlily native to large bodies of fresh water. Harvesting the plant and putting it in a vial creates a splash weapon against enemies, working as a minor form of the spell Tsunami (wall of water up to 10 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. On a failed save, damage is 2d10 Bludgeoning damage).
