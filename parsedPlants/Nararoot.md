A tuber found throughout Faerun, the green and purple leaves of the plant grow close to the ground, and a single thin stalk sprouts upward to reveal a flower with two wide petals. The root is often cut into shavings and either eaten directly, or brewed into a tea. Although terribly bitter, it primarily serves as a form of birth control, as ingesting it renders a person infertile for several weeks.
