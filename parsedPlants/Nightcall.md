A blue-grey herb smelling faintly of nutmeg that heightens the user's senses. Over-dosage or prolonged usage causes photosensitivity, distraction and nervousness; on the other hand, prolonged usage can also make the effects permanent. Nightcall gradually dyes the long-term user's hair, teeth, nails, horns, or scales midnight blue. (The minimum dose of 1 tsp gives the eater +100' sight range, +10% hearing, and +1 to Wisdom and Dexterity scores for up to 1d8 hours. Up to 4 doses will stack, but after the second dose, the user will make a DC 14 Wisdom Save. This DC increases by one after every dosage. If failed, the user becomes addicted and loses -100’ sight range (down to 3’), -10% hearing, and -1 to Wisdom and Dexterity scores while not under Nightcal’’s effects.)
