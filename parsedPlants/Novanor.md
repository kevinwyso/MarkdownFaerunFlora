Commonly found in many desert areas, Novanor is the fruit of a cactus of the same name, growing in small orange pustules along the cactusâ€™s underside. These fruits can be eaten as emergency water reserves in the middle of the desert, but also serve a darker, more dangerous purpose. Harvesting the fruit, drying them in the sun, and then soaking the dried fruit in the blood of a Lamia (those poor, misunderstood creatures) will create a sticky, scarlet paste called Blood Fire. After injury with a weapon coated with Blood Fire, the blood begins to rapidly oxygenate, essentially burning the target from the inside out, and sometimes leaving little more than a charred skeleton behind. The victim must make a DC 12 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the target will take 1d6+1 fire damage per round for the next 10 minutes or until cured. On a successful save, the target only takes 1d6+1 additional fire damage on the first hit. O
