Sticky, leafy herb that grows to 2 inches in large (up to 10 by 10 ft) beds that acts like catnip for dogs. Can be made into a thick grey substance called gash glue, which can stabilize a dying creature without making a medicine check. When used it this way, it also has the side effect of granting +1 on Animal Handling checks for the recipient.
