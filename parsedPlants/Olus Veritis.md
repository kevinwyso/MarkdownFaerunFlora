Olus Veritis is pale green in color and grows right on the edge of rivers. The leaves are rough in texture, and have tiny thorns all along their edges. A leaf should be baked in an oven for one hour and then dragged across the skin of the recipient, cutting their flesh very slightly. The recipient, must make a DC 17 Constitution save vs poison or be compelled to answer all questions, absolutely truthfully for the next 1d6 x 10 minutes. Up to three uses of the herb can be given in a 24 hour period. If any more than 3 are given, the recipient will die within 3 hours of the final dose, or instantly if 6 doses are administered.
