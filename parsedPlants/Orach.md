Orach grows to about 3 or 4 feet in height. It has a whitish stalk, pale green leaves and greenish-white flowers. The seeds must be gathered, bruised and left to stand in pure alcohol for six weeks. The mixture must then be drunk, one spoonful a day for a week. This tincture will cause extreme intoxication but also cure almost any disease. It leaves a yellow color in the skin.
