Extremely rare flower with a root that looks like a pale white fist, found in temperate forests with trees of at least 150 years of age. Fey within 20 yards can smell its earthy aroma and find it easily. If the root is pulped it can be made into Night Venom, which when added to a poison, adds an additional saving throw (at the poisons' normal DC) to the initial save against the poison. Failure causes the creature to fall asleep until the secondary effect of the poison kicks in.
