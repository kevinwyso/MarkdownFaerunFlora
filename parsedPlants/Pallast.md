Pallast is a willow-tree relative that grows up to about 30 feet tall in many temperate and tropical environments. When ground together with marshmallow root and imbibed, Pallast cures minor aches and pains, especially headaches and pain from abscessed teeth, sore muscles, and so forth. Pallast by itself can be turned into a very bitter pale powder, and is usually served in a heavily sweetened tea. (Relieves minor pains but does not restore lost hit points.)
