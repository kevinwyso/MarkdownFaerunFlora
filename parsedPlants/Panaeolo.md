Magical herb whose leaves tastes like leather and function as an ingested drug with no initial effect. Secondary effect after 1d4 hours is to increase all arcane spell save DCs by 2 for 1d4 hours and 1d8 psychic damage. A second dose within an hour of the first improves the effect to a +3 to save DCs and deals 2d8 psychic damage. Further doses only cause more and increasing psychic damage.
