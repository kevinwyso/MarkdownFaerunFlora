The root of a small, shrub-like plant with dark green, shiny leaves and thorns, Pattran is used to relax the muscles and encourage sleep. In mild dosages, Pattran causes a general feeling of relaxation, eases sore, strained or sprained muscles, and similar aches. In larger doses, Pattran causes sleepiness. Pattran tastes like a combination of mint and rich soil. (For sleep dosages, user may voluntarily choose to sleep well or, if resisting, make a DC 12 Constitution Save. Effects last 2d4 hours; if asleep, the user will sleep and awaken normally.)
