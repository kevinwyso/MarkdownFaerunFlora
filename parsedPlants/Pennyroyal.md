Pennyroyal is a low creeping herb with a squarish stem and small dark green leaves which grow in pairs. The flowers grow in round clusters which are mauve in hue. The leaves should be plucked and thrown into a personâ€™s bath water while still fresh. They may then have an aphrodisiac effect on anyone the recipient attempts to influence in the next 1d4 days (+1 to persuasion checks made within that period). In addition, if dried, the leaves may be sprinkled among books, and will then act as an insect repellent. These make the leaves highly prized among mages and sages who will normally pay between 12 and 15 gp for small amounts of the dried leaves.
