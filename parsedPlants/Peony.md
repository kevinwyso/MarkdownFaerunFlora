This plant with its delicate pink flowers may be boiled into a powerful healing draught, capable of stopping all bleeding, internal and external, immediately and healing for 1d8 hit points. However, a roll of 1 on the nature check by the herbalist, will kill the recipient in 1d4 minutes, as they suffer a massive heart attack. The herb can also be deliberately used as a poison by using five times the normal dosage.
