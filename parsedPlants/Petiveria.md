This plant has a single stem with dark green, shiny leaves growing from it. It is topped by very thin, yellow flowers. The petals of these flowers should be mixed into a poultice, where they will, on a successful application, act to bring down swelling and the discoloration from bruising over the course of a one-day period. Commonly used across the realm as a cold compress for blackeyes.
