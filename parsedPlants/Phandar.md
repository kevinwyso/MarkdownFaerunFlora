A knobby deciduous tree with mottled bark, the branches often grow away from the prevailing wind, often giving a copse of the trees the appearance of being almost blown over by strong winds. The branches support a surprising amount of small triangular leaves, and are the natural home for a species of moth that resemble the leaves. The strength of the wood lends itself to be an excellent choice for tool handles, bows, and small boats. The mul- ticolored grains are regularly in fashion for jewelry making in such places as Waterdeep and Suzail. However, because of excessive logging over several centuries, the tree can only be found in isolated copses, often far from centers of civilization.
