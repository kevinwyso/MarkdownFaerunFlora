Rare 1-foot tall and 1-foot diameter mushroom with a dark lavender cap that can be found in any woodland but is most common in temperate forests housing Fey. If boiled with cloth, the resulting fabric is dyed Lavender. It is the main ingredient for a red liquid called Memorybind, which allows a prepared caster to prepare an extra 1st level spell in exchange for reducing all save DCs by 2 until the next long rest.
