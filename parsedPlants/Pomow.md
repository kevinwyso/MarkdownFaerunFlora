A magically created dark-purple spheroid fruit-plant that grows to 1-2 feet across, serves as a hardy crop viable in a range of climates. Meat, root and seeds are edible and high in protein, core of the plant is filled with juice, the fibers are similar to cotton, and the rind can be used as a sharpening strap for fine blades. A new fruit starts growing as soon as the old one is plucked, taking 2 weeks to grow to maturity.
