A very common weed in both cities and plains alike, Psyllium is a broad-leafed ground plant with a central stalk that buds small green seeds. Psyllium is a useful plant that is commonly used to treat constipation, scurvy, and to aid in weight-loss. Aside from its common uses, Plantain Weed is one of the weeds and herbs mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.
