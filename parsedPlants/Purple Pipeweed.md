A short, purple weed that was originally a farm-field pest before it started being farmed itself can be dried and smoked, and is in fact very commonly smoked by spellcasters that focus on illusory magic. For one hours after smoking a quantity of pipeweed, the consumer is elevated to a higher state of imagination. This unfortunately gives them an increased chance of being surprised (enemies in combat will always will a surprise round against the pipeweed smoker while he or she is under its effects) but also increases the spell save DC of any illusion magic cast by the pipeweed user by +2.
