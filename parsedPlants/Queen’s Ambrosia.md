A low, waxy-leafed shrub plant with large yellow flowers pointed upward. These flowers collect water and the flowers’ natural nectar and pollen then sweeten the water and add some essence that makes the liquid inside slightly intoxicating. A common tradition in some parts of the realm is to have a picnic the day after a rainstorm next to a Queen’s Ambrosia bush so that the flowers may serve as refreshment for the old and for the young to sneak sips from.
