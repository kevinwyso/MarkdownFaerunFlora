Rainbowpetal grows as a stout, relatively straight stem with triangular green leaves, and reaches a height of 4' to 8'. Many fourpetaled flowers appear at the top of this stem forming a terminal spike of 12" to 16". The flowers of the Rainbowpetal can appear as any color and individual petals will even grow in distinct colors on the same flower. The petals of these flowers are thick, fleshy, and surprisingly nutritious. They are frequently boiled into a thick and flavorful porridge or dried and used in place of bread crumbs or cornmeal on fried food. If eaten raw, a single spike of Rainbowpetal flowers can sustain a normal sized human for a full day.
