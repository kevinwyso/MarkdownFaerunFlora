A short purple flower that grows close to the ground, the plant is generally little more than a few floppy leaves sitting above the soil. However, during the warmer months, the plant sprouts a cluster of small purple flowers that smell faintly of cinnamon. The petals of the flower are often steeped in hot water to create a tea that prevents conception. Any female drinking the tea is unable to become pregnant within the next two days.
