biome: Jungles and Swamps

These tall stalks that grow out of stagnant water end in a thick bulb with a hard shell. In the warmer months, the stalk withers, and the bulb falls off, to float around until the bulb softens and falls away to disperse the seeds within. The seeds sit freely in the shell, and when shaken make a slight rattling noise, which is unnerving when the wind rushes through a cluster of rattlestalks. Tribes that live in the swamps will often use the unnerving aspect of the rattlestalks to create fear inducing noisemakers that are then added to spears and other weapons. When rattled, those that have no knowledge of the rattlestalks must make a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw, or be Frightened for 1d4 minutes.
