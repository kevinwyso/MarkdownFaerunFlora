A climbing, running vine native to the open plain-lands that is nigh impossible to get rid of as it grows at least 1 ft per day even if cut down to a stub. Dried Razorvine provides excellent fire kindle. Light contact without the use of protective gear deals 1d6 points of damage, while e.g. falling into it deals up to 3d6 points of damage; but this damage is reduced by a creatureâ€™s natural armor bonus.
