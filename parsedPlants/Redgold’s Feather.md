Redgold's Feather grows as small, tight cluster of burnished, copper-colored, feather-shaped fronds near areas of thermal activity. The plant is impervious to heat, and some claim to have even seen it undergo instantaneous growth when exposed to direct flame. If the leaves of this plant are broken or crushed they give off an acerbic odor potent enough to wake a person from unconsciousness (even magical) or immediately recover from being dazed or disoriented. If the feathers are crushed and combined with sulfur and the essence of a naturally fiery creature, an alchemist can create a non-toxic liquid that will glow a bright orange for 36-48 hours (even after being consumed and digested).
