Redroot is a tangled mass of leafy shoots that grows close to the ground. While it does grow wild in a large swath of the Realms, it is also sometimes intentionally planted on farms. Pulling a ripened root from the ground reveals a large crimson colored tuber. The tuber is often turned into a curative paste which can be applied to wounds to soothe the pain and speed healing (+5 to any hit dice expended during a short rest). While helpful for healing, ingesting the root often causes nausea and vomiting (DC 16 Constitution Save to avoid vomiting and nausea for the next 1d4 hours).
