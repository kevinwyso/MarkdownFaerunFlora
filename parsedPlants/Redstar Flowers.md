A strange plant with a translucent pink stem, numerous small branches fork off of the main stem, each of them ending in a small red flower with five petals. Each flower has a small opening which leads down the branch to a small pool of sap. The sap has a sickeningly sweet aroma which draws in small insects, which then become disoriented and perish in the sap and are dissolved. The plant is often harvested for the sweet sap, which is sifted to remove the remains of insects. Next the sap is heated, and used to coat confections and pastries, which then hardens to become a glaze. Bakers in small cities will pay a large price for the raw sap.
