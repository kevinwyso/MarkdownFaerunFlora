This plant has a cluster of dark green leaves, with marked parallel veins at its base, a single stem topped by a cluster of tiny, pale orange flowers. The chopped leaves are applied to the flesh to reduce bruising. A successful application will remove slight bruises altogether within an hour, more severe bruises will take up to 8 hours.
