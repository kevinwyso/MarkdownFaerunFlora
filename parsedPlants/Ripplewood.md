Dark-green vine up to 400 ft long with no roots or leaves, native to the elemental planes of air but transplanted to the material plane. Ripplewood vines form massive twisted nests of at least 4 vines that grow upward from the top to hang from a cave ceiling or large tree. Often used by giant eagles and such to make nests. A cluster of vines can support 500 lb per 5 sq.ft.
