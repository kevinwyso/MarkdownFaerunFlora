A short tree that sprouts many thick, diverging branches and a plentiful amount of small ovular leaves. The bark is a light shade of red, and darkens during winter months. Due to the considerable amount of moisture that the trees retain, it is seen as a poor choice for burning. Rosecork wood will often take several hours of exposure to flame for enough water to evaporate to the point where the wood burns. It is for this reason that it is occasionally used in construction in areas surrounding volcanoes or in the construction of war-boats and battleships.
