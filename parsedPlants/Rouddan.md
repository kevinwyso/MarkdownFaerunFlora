A root vegetable, the leaves of the Rouddan are broad and soft. Known as the “red turnip of Fallingard” it is a staple food of nearby peasants. Due to necessity, a large variety of different methods of preparation have arisen, including a thick stew of Rouddan, and as a base for slop mashes. The root keeps well when kept in a cool and dry climate, and resists decomposition well. While they can be eaten raw, they are best soaked in broth or spiced water (heals for 1d4 hit points if eaten raw or 1d8 hit points if eaten in soup; the creation of soup can also split a single Rouddan into 8 servings).
