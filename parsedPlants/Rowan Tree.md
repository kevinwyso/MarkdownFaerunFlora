A small, deciduous tree that sprouts small bunches of white berries that quickly turn to red-orange in summer months. The tree, according to common folklore, is supposed to protect from evil spirits and bad luck, and planting one on your property used to be a common tradition. The berries can be eaten, but taste relatively foul and cause a slight diuretic effect. Use of Rowan wood is well documented in wand and staff making, and is supposed to yield slightly better results when used to cast spells in the fields of Abjuration and Divination.
