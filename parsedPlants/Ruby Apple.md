A legendary tree allegedly created by a by a female elf, most gifted in the cultivation of magically grown plants, in her final moments of life. It’s an apple tree that grows rubies instead of apples. Similar trees used to grow in the orchard at Lentari Farms prior to the area’s destruction. The trees are scattered around far-removed areas of forest and if one is stumbled across, the tree can be harvested for 2d4 fist sized rubies that each sell for 300 gp.
