The long stems of the rose are oddly free of thorns that grace other similar flowers, while the rose itself is abundant among the plantâ€™s setms, large, and red. The rose tends to grow in clumps with others of the same species. Smelling the rose has a curious effect, as the pleasing aroma causes people to blush. Extended exposure to the aroma causes exhaustion and light-headedness. Those that spend more than a few moments within 10 feet of a blushrose must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer Disadvantage on Constitution and Wisdom saving throws for as long as they remain within proximity and 2d6 minutes afterward. Some romantics declare that the blushrose brings the euphoric and lightheaded feelings of being in love to the forefront.
