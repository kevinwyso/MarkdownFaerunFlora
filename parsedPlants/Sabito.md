This shrub plant is found growing in the sands of coastal dunes and has leaves which are bluish in tinge. The root is dark blue in color and small, pill-like growths sprout from these roots. Consuming one of these growths will allow the recipient to breathe underwater for 10 minutes, by allowing them to absorb the oxygen in the water directly into their skin through osmosis. Their skin has a translucent appearance for these ten minutes. This process also works above water, but not as effectively, making it uncomfortable to do much of anything for the time spent above the surface.
