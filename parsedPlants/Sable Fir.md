A hardy tree that spreads runners from one original “mother” tree, sometimes creating entire forests from one tree. The Sable Fir allegedly makes for excellent arrow-shafts and turns a deep lustrous black if lumbered mid-winter and rubbed with hot oils, making for beautiful and valuable bows and staves.
