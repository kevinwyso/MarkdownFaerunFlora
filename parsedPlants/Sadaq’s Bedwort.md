Long regarded as a plant sacred to Druids and Rangers of Sadaq, Sadaq’s Bedwort is a low-growing ground cover plant found in beds near flooded plain areas and rivers. Preparation of the bedwort in sacramental wine under the light of the new moon will allow for the creation of a concoction called Sadaq’s Empathy. This concoction will allow the recipient to converse with plants and animals in the native tongue for a period of up to 12 hours after consumption. In addition, the recipient will also have lowered spell component costs for spells involving nature and plant growth, or that target plants and animals. Harvesting too much of a bed at the same time will cause the bed to begin to rot as the bed is actually a single organism that spreads deep into the earth.
