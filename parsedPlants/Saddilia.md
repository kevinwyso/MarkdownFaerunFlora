This rare tree can grow up to 60 feet tall and can survive to quite old ages. It has dark red wood, and equally dark blue leaves. The flowers, which grow in small bunches, are startling white, almost radiant. Its nuts have a very special property; each nut raises the Intelligence or Wisdom (determine randomly) of the eater by 0.1 point (20 nuts or 2 full points max). The effect lasts for a whole week, after which it fades again, although there is a 1% chance the effect is permanent. Around the tree there are often animals (squirrels, salmon) who eat the nuts on a regular basis, and are therefore quite intelligent, often possessing speech or even (DM’s discretion) spellcasting abilities. The number of nuts available varies greatly, depending on the age of the tree, the number of creatures aware of its existence, but mainly, of course, on the DM’s wishes.
