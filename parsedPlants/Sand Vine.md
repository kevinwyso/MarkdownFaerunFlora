Relatively rare rope-like seaweed found along temperate or warmer coasts. Grows both above and below water, commonly rooted to a small rock. Can be dried and used as rope. With alchemy, its juices can be made into Vine Oil, which is a topical anaesthetic granting a creature +5 temporary hit points. Lasts for 1 hour or until hit points are drained, has the side-effect that within 24 hours of use, a creature cannot stabilize on its own (so even with successful death saves, the creature or person must be assisted). Regular use gives a signature salt and slight rotten fish smell.
