A small, mildly invasive plant with almost star-shaped leaves and small, white or pink bell-shaped flowers atop a slender, offshooting stalk. Sanicle leaves should be crushed and left in white wine, the strained through a cloth and drunk. The resulting concoction, when consumed, has the effect of binding wounds so that they are not reopened by action. (+2 to rolls made with hit dice expended during a short rest.)
