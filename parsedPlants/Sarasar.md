A short, woody bush with very few leaves, commonly found near gullies and ravines, so the plants can collect as much water as possible. When the wood is burnt, it creates a long-lasting thick fog that will consistently stay in place for about as long as it is burning and then begins to fade, disappearing completely in one hour. The smoke fills a cubic volume of 10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.
