This dwarf tree is favored among nobility of the southern provinces, as it is easy to cultivate and grows quickly. The sparse leaves it produces are diamond shaped and light green with a tinge of pink on the edges. The exercise in restraint is one lesson that the Sasami Tree teaches children of the wealthy patience and restraint. Cutting off too many branches causes the tree to sicken and perish, while allowing the tree to grow wild often causes the tree to turn into an unruly mess. The leaves are often exchanged as a decorative gift between servants and their far-off relatives.
