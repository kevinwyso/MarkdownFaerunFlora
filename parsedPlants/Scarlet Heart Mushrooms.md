Large black mushrooms covered in heart-shaped red spots, those trekking through swamps may encounter this dangerous and obnoxious fungus. When a living creature comes within 5 feet of the fungus, the red spots are capable of detecting heat and will release a noxious cloud of spores within the same radius. Anyone within the affected area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 2d4 hours.
