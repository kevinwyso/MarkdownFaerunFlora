Scented mayweed grows to a height of about 2 feet. It has upright and branching stems, small leaves, and white flowers with a yellow center. The flowers must be crushed, emitting a pungent odor if prepared correctly, and should then be applied to the eyes in order to heal damage to them caused by acid or poison. If used within a day of the injury, they can prevent blindness. Aside from its common uses, Scented Mayweed is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.
