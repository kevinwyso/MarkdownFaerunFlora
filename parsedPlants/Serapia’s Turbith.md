This herb will place the recipient into a deep sleep for 24 full hours. The recipient cannot be woken even by magical means. At the end of the day, all wounds will be healed and hit points regained. It does not, of course, resurrect a dead person, but the plantâ€™s magically induced coma will in fact regenerate lost limbs.
