The fungus appears to be a cluster of small yellow beads, often growing on decomposing matter. Small black stems hold them aloft, and their surface is shiny enough to reflect torchlight. While the fungus may appear like berries, they are quite poisonous. Underdark denizens will often collect the fungus wearing leather gloves to prevent touching it with their skin. When the fungi are touched with bare hands must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be Paralyzed for 1d4 hours and begin to sweat profusely. Those that fail the saving throw by 5 or more suffer 24 (8d6) poison damage.
