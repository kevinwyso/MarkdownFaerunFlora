A rugged, thorny plant found by the sea. The leaves must be boiled for two hours in salt water, and the resultant mix sweetened with honey. This mixture will act as a cure for certain types of longterm, typically incurable ingested poisons or wasting diseases (DMâ€™s discretion, as to which ones). The recipient must be made to drink one dose immediately when the mixture is ready, and then further doses every twelve hours for three days (7 doses in all). If the number of successful applications is four or more, the patient will recover.
