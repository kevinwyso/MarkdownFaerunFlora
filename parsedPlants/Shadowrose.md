A perfectly black rose bush, with black roots, stems, leaves, and buds, that grows only in deep caves and wilts in the presence of any light, magic or non-magic, brighter than a candle. When the petals of this rose are consumed, it will grant a regeneration rate of 3 hit points per round for 2d10 rounds. After that, the recipient will be unable to perform any action, including movement, for 2 rounds.
