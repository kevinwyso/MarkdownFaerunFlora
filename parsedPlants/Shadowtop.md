A rather tall and fast-growing tree that can be found throughout Faerun. The leaves only grow at the very top of the tree and appear dark green from above and have a copper hue from beneath. These leaves are also highly flammable, and are often gathered to be used as tinder. The wood of the tree is quite fibrous, but not dense enough to be worthwhile building material. Instead the strands are often broken down and woven into thick rope. The wood burns fairly hot and long and without an abundance of smoke, thus making it ideal for use in hearth fires and torches.
