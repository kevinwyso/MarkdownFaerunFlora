A small, button mushroom that can be milked to harvest a shiny black liquid. This liquid, if consumed or absorbed through the skin, will cause the recipient to mope about vocally, and loudly question their choices in life. Affected creatures just want to lean against the wall and cry. A save is allowed for every instance they are slapped by another person, DC 16 Wisdom Save, with a cumulative -1 to the DC per slap.
