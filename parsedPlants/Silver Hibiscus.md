This silver-grey plant looks as though it represents madness itself. It often has random patterns and unplanned shapes, but always has a black web-like pattern on it. If touched bare-handed, the target must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save or take 2d6 Psychic damage. When prepared correctly, the leaf can take on the special qualities of the elements and grant a talentaed herbalist 3 uses of an elemental breath weapon, randomly chosen from Lightning, Poison, Fire, or Acid.
