Only blooming by the light of a full moon, the plant appears to be largely nondescript until seen at night in full bloom. The entire plant is basked in a silvery glow, and the flower is large and luminescent white. At the end of the night the flower falls off of the plant and quickly wilts in the morning sun. However, before the flower wilts, it can be ground into a fine powder, the mere smell of which repels lycanthropes, who take a -8 penalty to initiative when in the presence of the fresh flower.
