The red leaves of this unusually twisted tree should be burned, and the smoke inhaled. This will have the effect of ‘dilating’ time (making it appear to pass slower.) For every minute experienced outside the influence of the herb, only thirty seconds will actually pass. A single dose is effective for 1d6 hours. Normally used by torturers to prolong agony, the leaves may also be used by people who must think quickly. It does not increase the speed at which a person moves but you may be able to see an opponent telegraph their movements more easily. (DC 20 Dexterity Save when a melee attack is targeted toward you, on a successful save, your AC increases by 2 for the period of that attack.) However, Sinquoi also causes side-effects in the form of halved movement speed for 1d6 hours after the initial dosage wears off.
