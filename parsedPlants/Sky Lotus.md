White, stemless flower native to high altitudes that can be found floating lazily through the air between 4 and 15 feet off the ground. Provides 1 day of nutrition if eaten but contains trace amounts of arsenic that can affect creatures that eat a lot of them (DC 5 Constitution save that increases by 1 on each consecutive flower eaten, 2d8 poison damage on a failed save). If oil is collected from 10 sky lotuses, it produces a natural potion of levitation that is also a full dose of poison (DC 15 Constitution save, 2d12 poison damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful save).
