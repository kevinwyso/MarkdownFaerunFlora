A tropical, creeping ground vine that has small serrated leaves resembling the leaves of blackberry bushes. Instead of producing blackberries, however, this vine produces small pink berries that can be mashed into a pulp and consumed. Although exceedingly sour, this mixture will grant advantage on the saving throw for the next spell that is cast upon you. Lasts until this spell is cast or 24 hours if no such spell is cast.
