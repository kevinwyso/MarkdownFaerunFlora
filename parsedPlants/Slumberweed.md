Dried and powdered leaves of this blue-green fuzzy plant, if consumed, can cause a sleeplike state that resembles death for 8 hours (Constitution Save DC 13 negates). Can also be turned into a poultice and delivered via blowgun (no Constitution save required to place the victim into sleep if delivered this way).
