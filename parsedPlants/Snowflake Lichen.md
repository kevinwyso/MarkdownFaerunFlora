Magical plant that looks like snow and grows on rocks in cold climates; it leeches heat from any and and all sources. Within 10 feet of the lichen, the temperature grows noticeably colder. Within 5 feet, the creature must make a DC 12 Constitution save, taking 2d6 cold damage on a failed save. Touching, even with protective gloves or armor, causes 2d12 cold damage on a failed DC 15 Constitution save.
