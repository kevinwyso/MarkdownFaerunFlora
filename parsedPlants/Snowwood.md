A pale tree with a slightly bluish cast to the mottled bark, growing predominantly in the far north. The trunks of the trees are often thin and dense, with spindly limbs and dark green leaves. The mottled coloration of the bark often forms into shapes that vaguely resemble faces, and a few tribes hold a belief that the trees hold the spirits of ancestors that watch over and protect them. The trees are quite remarkable as they can survive in some of the coldest climates, and have even been seen as far north as the High Ice and the Reghed Glacier. The roots of the tree often stretch deep, anchoring the tree in places where other vegetation would find difficult purchase.
