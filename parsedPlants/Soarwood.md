Rare wood native to Aerenal that possesses magical buoyancy. Water-vessels made from Soarwood cost quadruple price to construct, but move at double speed and are more reliable in rough conditions. Soarwood is 75% lighter than regular wood. It is a necessary component for the construction of Eberron-style airships, and when worked into an airship, it becomes naturally lighter than air.
