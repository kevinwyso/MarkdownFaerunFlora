A single stalk bearing a number of curled leaves, the sweet berries of the plant are known throughout Faerun, and they sparkle radiantly in direct sunlight. Villagers often know of nearby patches of wild sparkle berries, and pick them in mid-summer. The berries have a variety of methods by which they are eaten. Fresh berries are often served with cheese, and many are processed into jams and jellies to be preserved for later. Consumption of the raw berries grants resistance to Radiant damage for 10 minutes while consumption of the jam or jelly grants the same resistance for 5 minutes.
