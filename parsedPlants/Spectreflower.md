This highly unusual plant grows in the deepest parts of dark forests, far from the eyes of civilization. The stalk is a blue-green color, and several pale leaves grow along the length. During nights of the full moon the plant buds a flower, which appears wispy and translucent. Attemping to touch the flower reveals that it is incorporeal, and has the substance of smoke. Come morning the flower disperses on the wind, sending the seeds of the flower on their path. The roots of the flower can be used to make an oil that allows blades to strike incorporeal creatures, called Ghostbane Oil. Using the roots of the Specterflower, alchemists are capable of distilling an oil, that when applied correctly, allows non-magical weapons to inflict full damage upon incorporeal creatures as if they were physical creatures. The benefit lasts only for a few swings, up to the DMâ€™s discretion.
