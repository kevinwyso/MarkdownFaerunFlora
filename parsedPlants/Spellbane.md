A small but tenacious plant that grows in shadowed areas, clinging to rocks. The wide ragged leaves of the plant are filled with vibrant blue veins, and at night in the spring it produces small delicate blue flowers which crumble with the slightest touch. Surprisingly, the plant has an interesting effect upon magic users and magical creatures. Those that ingest parts of the plant lose the ability to cast spells and gain an increased resistance to magic for 3d4 days.
