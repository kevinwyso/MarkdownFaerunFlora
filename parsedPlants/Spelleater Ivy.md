An undergrowth plant resembling ivy with a silvery sheen to its leaves, sometimes mistaken for poison ivy. Any spells cast within 20' are absorbed by the ivy. It immediately grows a new 10'x10' section per level of the spell slot used. Direct and unprotected contact with the plant supposedly imbues or causes innate magical ability to surface in non-magic-users and magic users alike, granting a temporary wizard cantrip to the recipient. Eating or smoking the leaves causes astonishing visions and requires a DC 18 Wisdom Save vs Insanity. If collected and dried in large amounts, talented craftspeople can craft anti-magic armor. While helpful, the armor is also incredibly volatile, exploding after absorbing 1d4 spells, releasing all spells and burning the wearer for d8 equal to the amount of spells the armor has captured.
