A pale white moss that often grows on dead trees in marshy environments. Those familiar with the moss know to avoid it, as it attacks the living. Those that approach within 10 feet cause the moss to violently thrash about, forcing those within the area to make Dexterity saving throws, DC 13, or be grappled by the moss. Escaping the grasp of the moss requires a Strength saving throw, DC 11. The moss then implants spores that burrow into the skin of the trapped creature, inflicting 1d6+1 damage per round. After the creature is implanted, they suffer Disadvantage to all attribute and skill checks, as a terrible malaise washes over them. Once the creature dies, the body sprouts a new mass of spirit moss. The implanted spores can be destroyed by the application of heat to the affected area on the round after implantation, or with a Lesser Restoration or similar magic after that point.
