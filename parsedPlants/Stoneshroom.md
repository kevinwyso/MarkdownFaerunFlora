biome: Underdark/Caves
---
Chalky, rock-looking fungus native to the Underdark that is both edible (1 stoneshroom =1 meal) and produces highly oxygenated spores that function as a form of breathable air. Also, for 24 hours after eating a stoneshroom, a creature can hold its breath twice as long as normal. Stoneshroom subsists on minerals in the rock and remains edible for 1 day after picking. With the proper nature check, smaller stoneshroom can be inserted into the nostrils to sustain breathing underwater or through poisonous gas.
