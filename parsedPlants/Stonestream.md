Given the name by gnomes, Stonestream is a small lichen that produces a clear syrupy liquid that then drizzles down the sides of rocks that the lichen lives on. Collecting this syrup and heating into a tea for consumption will turn the user into stone for 2d4 hours. During this time, any poison or toxins, and most diseases, will be purged from the system into the stone surroundings. While turned to stone, the user takes one hit point of damage per hour, and any damage taken as a stone remains after the recipient has turned back from stone.
