A leafy plant with small pink flowers that grows in bunches in open fields. The plant is rather unremarkable, except for its tenacity and resilience. Farmers will often complain that it chokes out other crops, unless it is pulled up by the root and no remnants of the plant remains, and livestock often refuse to eat it. The true worth of the plant is when it is ground into a powder and turned into a paste. Spreading it on exposed flesh causes the skin to become hardened and stiff, resilient enough to resist slashes and stabs. Grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class for 2d6 minutes. However, more than a single application per day of the paste inflicts a -1 penalty on Dexterity based skill checks and saving throws when applied, as the skin begins to stiffen and become numb.
