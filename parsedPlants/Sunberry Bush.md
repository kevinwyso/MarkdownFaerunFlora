A large bush with light green oval leaves, the branches are studded with small thorns. During the spring months the bush is covered with small golden flowers. The golden berries of the bush grow with small protrusions, giving them the appearance of a small flaming sun. While the freshly cut berries are sour, leaving them to sit in the sun for a day or two after being picked turns them remarkably sweet. The berries are often picked for Sunberry Wine. This wine is remarkably popular with Rangers, increasing the effective range of their weapons by 10 feet and granting them immunity to environmental cold, as well as flushed cheeks.
