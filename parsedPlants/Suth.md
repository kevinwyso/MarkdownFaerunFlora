A tree with dark grey bark, and branches which sprout almost horizontally from the trunk for some distance before abruptly changing angles. The branches of multiple trees growing close together often grow together, becoming a tangled mass, and sometimes creating natural walls. The olive-green leaves are long and fluffy, but sport a spike at the end which often makes attempting to push through the interlaced branches a painful task. The wood of the tree is renowned for being hard and durable, making the process of cutting them down very difficult. Thus, in some areas where lumbering has cleared away large swaths of trees, there are large copses of tangled Suth trees left untouched. When the trees have been cut down, however, it was found that they work wonderfully as shield-wood, especially since soaking it in water before battle keeps it from catching fire.
