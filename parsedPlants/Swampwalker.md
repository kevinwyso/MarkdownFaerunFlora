biome: Jungles and Swamps
---
A curious plant that has caused more than a few strange tales from the rural villagers, the Swampwalker seems to stand out of the water, supported by a mass of tendrils, and sprouting a clump of pink flowers that attract various insects. Each tendril is the thickness of a finger, and due to slow currents in the swamp, the tendrils often clump together or break off entirely, causing the plant to look like a looming figure standing on the surface of the brackish water. One legend has it that the plants come alive during the darkest of nights. They stalk nearby villages hoping to catch the unwary and drag them back to watery graves. Whether this is true or not is completely unknown.
