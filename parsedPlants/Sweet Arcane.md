biome: Rivers and Swamps
---
A short river grass found alongside rivers and other bodies of water in humid, tropical environments. When this grass is ground into a cud with honey, the resulting decoction is a syrupy sweet treat that will allow spellcasters to memorize and prepare one extra spell per day. The level of the spell is determined by the number of grass used (12 stalks per level), and can only be of a level for which the caster has slots. Last 1d4 days.
