A family of rare plants, closely guarded where they grow in any number, with oily, deep-green leaves in the shape of stars growing from a central woody-stemmed bush. These oily leaves can be steeped in hot water to extract an oil, that when applied via contact in large quantities, acts as a paralytic that was previously used for surgery until its use as a poison for the torture and assassination of a powerful king several decades ago. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw vs. poison or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is paralyzed and unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage but remains paralyzed except for the movement of their eyes.
