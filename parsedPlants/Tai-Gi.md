The ground and powdered root of this small, almost-flat plant will, if eaten, increase the efficiency of all a personâ€™s five senses by 5 times for a period of 2d6 hours. They will be able to see five times as far, and things five times as small, track by scent alone, hear the smallest sounds, and even taste many poisons on their tongues, granting double advantage on perception rolls for any sense. A side effect is that they are also five times as susceptible to pain. (For each hit point of damage, the person must roll under their constitution minus damage taken. For example, if someone with a Constitution of 15 was hit for 6 points of damage, they would have to roll under 9 on a d20. If the person ever takes more damage than their Constitution score while under the influence of this herb, they have an 80% chance of instant death, just from the pain.)
