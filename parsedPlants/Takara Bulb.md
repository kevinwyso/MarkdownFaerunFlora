A large bulbous mass that grows a half-dozen shoots, each ending in a single, large leaf. The bulb is dark brown or even red in coloration, while the leaves are a light green with red veins. During the spring a single large red flower forms at the center of the bulb. The bulb can be harvested and eaten raw, although it often tastes better after having been cooked. Many small mountain villages cultivate the bulb, as the plant grows well in rocky soil. (Heals for 1d4-1 hit points if eaten raw or 1d6+1 hit points if cooked).
