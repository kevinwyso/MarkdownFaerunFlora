Growing out of the seabed, this dark-green rope-like kelp grows in shallow sea waters near coastlines and reefs and is both a blessing and a bane to sailors. The kelp often tangles oars, fishing nets, crab traps, and rudders. However, more than a few sailors stuck in the doldrums near a desolate island have survived off of little more than the purified water contained within the kelpâ€™s stalks and barrel-like fruit, as well as the schools of fish that dwell among the fronds.
