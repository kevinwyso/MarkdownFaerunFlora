A soft, flowing, amber grain on a flexible stalk that grows in large patches in the middle of open fields. The grain often blows violently even in a low breeze, and will tangle up in itself, creating giant mats of grain that then slowly dies due to cramping and underwatering. The grain can be ground and turned into a meal that, in turn, can be mixed with water and baked to create a simple but filling flatbread.
