Tansy grows in small patches of 1 to 3-foot stalked plants with yellow button flowers. Commonly grown in cities outside of homes and personal properties, Tansy has traditionally been used to keep away flies and pests. According to legends of old, Tansy comes from the word “athanasia” which means “immortality,” and the use of this word for the flower relates to a tale of monks reading about local flora and a story about a hero of yore, Brandalier the Brave, in which the ruler of Brandalier’s kingdom states “Take him hence, and when he has tasted immortality let him return to us,” referring to this flower, or something similar.
