The Tateesha bush is a low-lying shrub with long thin leaves and small brown nuts. These nuts may be chewed to provide a shortlived feeling of euphoria, and are mildly addictive. They have the side effect of staining the teeth, making it easy to find a tateesha addict. The flowers, called silks, bloom only in spring, and if gathered and dried for one week form a powerful narcotic which may be smoked. For 2d10 minutes after smoking, the persons’ insight skill is increased by +2, but for 1d4 hours after this, a state of distortion ensues, and the recipient’s Intelligence and Wisdom drop by -2 from their normal levels. Prolonged use causes the user to collapse into an almost dreamlike trance. The drug is highly addictive, and after only two uses, the user must make a DC 16 Cons. Save or become addicted, with a +1 to the save DC after each dose from here on out. Addicts lapse into the dreamlike trance stated above until their next exposure to the drug or until cured of addiction.
