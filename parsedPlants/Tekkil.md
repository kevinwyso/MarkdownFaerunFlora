A succulent swamp plant with fat red leaves, which when chewed, function as an analgesic drug. Initially no effect, but after a few minutes, the user becomes almost entirely fearless, gaining +5 to Wisdom and Intelligence Saves against fear, and becoming immune to the Frightened effect for the next 1d20+10 minutes. Drug also grants a -5 penalty to all Dexerity saves for the next 1d4 hours. Overdose occurs with a second dose during the original duration and causes halved movement speed for 2d4 hours as well as the negative Dexterity side-effect.
