A bushy climbing vine with tubular yellow flowers, the leaves and flowers of tempin can be boiled and made into a poultice that will draw out poisons from bites and stings and allow the wound to heal cleanly and without complications. (When poultice is applied within 1 round of taking poison damage, the recipient may make an extra Cons. Save vs poison to avoid the Poisoned effect. Also grants +1 hit points to recovery hit dice expended during every short rest for the first 2 days after poultice is applied.)
