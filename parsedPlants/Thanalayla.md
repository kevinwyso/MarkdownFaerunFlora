A long stalk covered in small thorns and ending in a thick bulb, the plant hangs down from the branches of other trees. Thanalalya is a predatory plant, the stalks have their roots embedded in branches of trees, yet they cause no harm to their host tree. The plant instead secretes a sicky resin that smells musky and attracts insects and small birds. Smaller insects are trapped in the resin, while the stalk curls around birds that would be capable of breaking free of the resin, gripping and impaling them with the thorns. The resin slowly dissolves the prey, providing nutrients to the Thanalalya. The Thanalayla, according to wivesâ€™ tales, also wards off lesser fey and this may be the case because pixies can also get caught in its sticky resin.
