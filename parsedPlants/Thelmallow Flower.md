biome: Swamps
---
A floating plant that inhabits marshes and swamps, the plant produces wide, waxy leaves that arc minutely out of the water, which are often the haven for mosquitos. The plant also buds large pale flowers with ragged petals that attract swamp flies. Grinding up the flower creates a paste which, when combined with paste made from Vaundyr Vine, is used to create Spellslayer wine. Although the wine is quite refreshing, tasty, and light, it also reduces the magical ability of spellcasters, causing a permanent decrease to the amount of spell slots available at a given level (at the DMâ€™s discretion).
