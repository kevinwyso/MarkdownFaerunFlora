A spiky, medium-length grass that grows in patches in areas of direct sunlight. As summer turns into fall, the tips of the grass begin to swell and turn into white, thimble shaped flowers. These flowers are a common cure for fevers and involved in a remedy that allows for a delay in the onset of illness or its symptoms.
