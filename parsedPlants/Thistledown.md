A very tall strain of thistle, growing often to 8 feet tall or more, can be harvested for the fibers within the central stalk. These fibers can be turned into a silken fabric by elves that can be worked into armor to make it easier to move in, increasing AC by 1 and increasing movement speed by 5 feet. Crafting with thistledown requires master leveling training from an elven craftsperson or a nature check of 25+.
