Thyme can grow up to a foot in height. A small, ornamental evergreen, Thyme has tiny dark green leaves. In spring it has many sweet scented mauve flowers. The smell is so strong that the herb is often smelt before it is seen. These flowers must be dried and then mixed with fresh, clear water to produce an antiseptic lotion. This lotion can then be applied to infected wounds. Aside from its common uses, Thyme is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.
