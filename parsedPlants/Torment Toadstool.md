Large blue mushrooms found in swamps all over Faerun, most people are careful not to step on the toadstools. Some villagers purposefully propagate and harvest the mushrooms in order to make a particularly earthy tasting ale. Those that step on the toadstool cause it to rupture and release a cloud of spores within a 5-ft radius. Those that inhale the spores must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated while vomiting for the next minute.
