A thick black vine that grows along the floors of caves and caverns and subsists on the nutrients leftover from the meals of Giant Spiders. Cutting open a Trathua Vine and drinking the liquid inside will make the character impervious to poison damage and negative poisoned effects from spiders for 2d6 hours. However, the liquid inside the vines clings to the mouth like cobwebs.
