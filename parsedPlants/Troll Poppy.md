A bright blue poppy flower commonly used to bribe trolls for safe passage through a monster-filled area. Trolls go wild for these flowers and will eat them as soon as they lay eyes on them. Usually found in large patches in open fields, 2d8 flowers can be harvested per 5 foot by 5 foot area. In addition to their use with trolls, the petals of troll poppies can be dried, crumbled, and smoked. When smoked, user will not be able to rest or sleep for the next 6d4 hours. During this time, the user can never lose consciousness unless dead, not from exhaustion, magical sleep, or poisons. After this period has passed, the user falls unconscious for 1d4 hours.
