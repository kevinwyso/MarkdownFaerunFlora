A legendary sapling that is said to have been accidentally created during a series of experiments involving the repeated grafting of various magically enhanced roots onto treants, from which seeds were planted to create saplings that were then grafted with each other and so on. The trueroot saplings are said to have pulled magical energy from an unknown place, and this magical energy could be channeled into other plants to accelerate their growth to be 10 times faster, or be channeled by spellcasters to give perfect health and “almost limitless spellcasting”. The trueroot died after small cuttings were taken to propagate it and there have been no known successes in recreating it.
