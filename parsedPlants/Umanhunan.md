A tall tree that grows branches high off of the ground, the bushy leaves are dark green on the underside, and a very pale shade on top. The bark of the tree is rough and mottled between dark red and light brown. Locals often burn boughs of the tree in sacrifice to the goddess Kaâ€™ino, in hopes of bringing rainfall. Breathing in the fumes of burning Umanhunan leaves causes mild hallucinations and euphoria.
