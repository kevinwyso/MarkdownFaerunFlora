This hardy plant grows on the seaward side of many cliffs, looking out over the ocean. The vine clings to the rocks, and the broad fluffy leaves gather moisture from the wind. During the warmer months, the plant -lowers, producing long, sharp yellow petals tinged with crimson on the edges. Tea made from the flower petals is highly sought after, as it includes a wide variety of medicinal uses. Some nobles believe that drinking a single cup of Umozokai Tea a day ensures longevity.
