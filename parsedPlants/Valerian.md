Valerian grows to a height of about 3 feet, and has one hollow and furry stem. It has large, pale green, serrated leaves along the length of this stalk which slits into flowers stems with small pink flowers at its top. The root is the useful part of this plant and should be grated into boiling water and the resulting infusion drunk in order to ease the spasms of somebody who is subject to fits or seizures. A successful application will stop all fits for 1d12 hours. The scent of the bruised or cut root also can be used to attract rats. According to some versions of the legend, the Pied Piper of Fendaire-by-the-Sea used this herb to lead the rats from the town.
