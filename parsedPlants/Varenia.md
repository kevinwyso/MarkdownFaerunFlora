A tall, woody-stemmed flower that grows during spring and summer months. The blooms are almost a foot across and a bright crimson red. The inside is filled with a large quantity of nectar, making the flower very popular among a large variety of birds. During the fall, as the plant starts to die in cooler temperatures, the nectar begins to spoil and take in bits and pieces of disintegrating plant matter which turns the nectar into a thicker, foul-smelling salve that can be applied to regenerate a lost limb or body part. The regeneration cycle takes 3 full days. There is a 10% chance the limb will be mutated in some manner
