biome: Swamps and Jungles

A thorny, thin vine that grows in wetter areas such as swamps and jungles. The waxy leaves are ground to create Alarvaun, a component for Spellslayer wine along with Thelmallow Flower. Although the wine is quite refreshing, tasty, and light, it also reduces the magical ability of spellcasters, causing a permanent decrease to the amount of spell slots available at a given level (at the DMâ€™s discretion).
