A large, pink vine fruit about the size of a small watermelon. Commonly pressed and fermented to create a dwarvish wine called Woebegetter Wine. This wine has the strange side-effect of allowing the drinker to hear the thoughts of anyone in a 5-mile radius of themselves that has been drinking Woebegetter Wine in the past 6 hours. This can be really useful if you're trying to coordinate a silent attack, and it can be dreadful if the people you're attacking are also drinking Woebegetter Wine, but keeping their thoughts mute so that you don't know that they know what you're doing. The effects last for 1d20 minutes per cup.
