Lurking on the surface of stagnant pools of water deep in the marshes, this slime is deadly to those that are caught unaware. Noticing the shimmer of violet indicating the slime lingering on the surface requires a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) skill check. While entering the pool the slime remains inert, but once the victim emerges from the pool, the slime clings to them. The slime becomes highly corrosive when removed from the pool and inflicts 2d6 acid damage per round until it is washed off with water or exposed to bright light or fire. The corrosion only damages organic material, thus ignoring metal armor.
