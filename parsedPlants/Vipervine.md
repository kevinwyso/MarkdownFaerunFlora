A hanging, invasive vine that grows through the upper canopies of swamps and tropical jungles that sprout thing, curly leaves, slightly resembling a hanging snake. Commonly used as a smoked herb, Viper Weed is slightly poisonous and causes auditory hallucinations if too much is smoked, and will also cause a person to get sick, in an almost identical illness to food poisoning. Some have said that the hallucinations tell secrets about the company you keep, but scientific minds have thrown that away as untrue.
