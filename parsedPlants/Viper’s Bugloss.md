Viper’s Bugloss is a blue flowered stalk plant that is found growing invasively in open fields and on farmland. The flowers can be distilled, and a minor poison can be drawn from the petals, capable of doing 1d6 poison damage after consumption, but the leaves of the plant can also be used to treat skin conditions and to cause an increase in levels of arousal. Aside from its common uses, Viper’s Bugloss is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.
