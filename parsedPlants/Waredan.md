A surprisingly hardy dwarf tree that grows about 5â€™ or slightly less. The hard, waxy leaves of this tree can be combined sugar water in a boiling process to yield a concoction that, when injected into the bloodstream of a lycanthrope, will cause the lycanthrope to be unable to change form for 12 hours, even in the presence of magic that would cause this change instantaneously, like the spell Moonbeam.
