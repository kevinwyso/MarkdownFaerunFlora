A strange and small plant that is often found growing on rotting logs and animal droppings, the plant lacks much of a root system. The leaves are small and curled around the flowering part of the plant. Once the plant reaches maturity, the leaves fall away to reveal tightly curled pale flowers that appear to be large maggots to the untrained eye. Birds often eat the flowers, thus spreading the seeds far and wide. Grinding the flowers into paste and boiling them produces a waxy substance which woodworkers can use to seal their work from moisture. Painters also seek out the substance, as it causes the colors to resist fading over the years.
