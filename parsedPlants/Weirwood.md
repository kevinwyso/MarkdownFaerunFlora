Rare oak-like tree with leaves that are a silver-sheen brown on top and velvet black on the underside, often protected by Dryads and Treants. Can grow huge and many-branched, will not burn from non-magical fire, and imparts a warm clear tone to musical instruments made from it. It can replace oak or holly in any spell, and living Weirwood has quadruple fire resistance (no means to preserve this quality after harvesting is known). Weirwood within the illumination radius of a magical light source emits light as a candle for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area.
