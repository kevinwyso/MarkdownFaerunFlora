A short, leafy bush that produces small lilac flowers on the spring solstice. 2d8 flowers can be harvested from a single bush, and the petals of these flowers can be crushed and sprinkled over food to preserve the food for 1 week. There will be a faint trace of generic flower-like notes in the taste.
