This climbing vine has greenish-white star shaped flowers, each bearing five petals, and has green berries which turn red when ripe. It has a root, something like a huge turnip, and this root should be ground up and boiled in water and drunk as a cure for pneumonia. In addition, the berries are commonly collected to make Byrony Jam, a staple of breakfasts in the norther climes.
