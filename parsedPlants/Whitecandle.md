A tall, flowered plant with silvery-green leaves. When the flowers are mixed with water or wine and applied directly to a wound, they act as a painkiller. (Grants 1d4 temporary hit points to an injured target immediately, but these points are lost as the effect wears off in 2 hours. Further applications before the previous one has worn off are ineffective.)
