Brilliant orange-red summer-flower found in temperate plains and farmland. Crushed petals give of a lovely smell for 1 week. The stem can be made into a substance called Mindfire, which when added to an ingested poison, imposes a -2 penalty to Cons. Saves to those who fail a save against the poison, and forces casters to make concentration checks (DC 15 + spell level) to cast spells.
