A flexible wood that can be worked into armor (counts as masterwork, +1 AC, Dex +1, negates stealth disadvantage on heavy armor styles). Wildwood heals a point of damage over 24 hours if exposed to sunlight for at least 1 hour, or, heals 5 points if also left to soak in water for 8 hours. Cost is double that of ordinary masterwork equivalent, but crating time is unaffected, and crafting requires craft (woodworking).
