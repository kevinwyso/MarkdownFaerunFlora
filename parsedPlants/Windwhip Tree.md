biome: Plains

Growing in small clumps in vast open plains, the tree grows straight up until it splits into thousands of willowy branches. Each of these branches are thin and whip-like, and are covered in small clumps of light green leaves and small red thorns. The bark of the tree is dark brown with lighter brown spots around the base of the tree. When the wind blows across the plains, the flexible branches and trunk bend far over. When the wind suddenly abates, the trunk abruptly snaps back into place, and the flexible branches make a popping noise not unlike the crack of a whip. This also causes the tree to fling their seeds far and wide. While the springiness of the wood makes it unacceptable to use for most construction, it has been quite popular in the construction of ballistae.
