This incredibly rare fungus has become something of a fable among herbalists. It is reported to have a large, translucent-blue bulbous cap growing atop a thin stem, and to normally form in small clusters deep within damp cave environments and forests. When consumed, the recipient first takes 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 15. Cons. Save to keep it down. On a successful save, the recipient will gain the secondary effect of the wispstalk, becoming transparents but not invisible for 1d8 minutes; on a failed save, nothing happens except for the recipient coughing up what part of the fungus they tried to get down.
