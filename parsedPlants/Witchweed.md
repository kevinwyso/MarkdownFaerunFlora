A plant whose leaves and stalks can be refined into a paste, which is then rolled into a smoke-stick of sorts that creates 10 ft cube of light smoke (no concealment) that forces casters to make a concentration check as if casting defensively or lose focus on the spell due to bouts of uncontrollable sneezing. The smoke is effective for 30 seconds.
