Herb with green gossamer-like fronds which, due to its rapid growth cycle, is found only in the spring in temperate, subtropical or tropical areas. Deters slugs and other pests. If powdered, it can be made into Wittlewort brew, which grants those under Charm effects another saving throw (if the effect allowed one).
