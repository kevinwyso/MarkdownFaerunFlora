A small conical mushroom that grows in the Underdark. The stem of the mushroom is pale white, and the cap is generally light orange to dark ochre in color, and sometimes covered in spots. Drow often collect the mushroom, as even though it is bitter while it is still fresh, cooking the fungus over an open flame causes it to shrink and take on a surprisingly meaty flavor. Some underkdarkdwelling chefs send out foraging parties to harvest the mushroom so that it can be prepared for feasts.
