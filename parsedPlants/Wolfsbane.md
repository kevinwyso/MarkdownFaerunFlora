This small (15-cm) plant has black green leaves, sawed deeply several times, and three flower stalks with tiny white flowers and brown seed pods. The flowers can be crushed into dust and carried in the pocket to have the effect of granting a +2 on a Constitution saving throw vs poison to avoid lycanthropy. The protection lasts for 2d4 x 10 minutes and makes tracking from lycanthropes harder. In addition, the seeds can be consumed (DC 20 Cons. Save) to fully avoid the repercussions of lycanthropy.
