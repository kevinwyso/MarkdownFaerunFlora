The effects of this herb last for two hours. During this time the character is granted +10 temporary hit points and can function beyond the point of exhaustion. Wormwood normally grows to about four feet in height. It has a stiff and angular stem, reddish brown in color. It has deeply incised smooth leaves which are silvery white with a slight tinge of green. It has small, yellow-green flowers arranged in long spikes at the top of the stem. The herb is also a rather effective insect repellent and is often left with clothing to keep fleas away. It also makes a very effective antiseptic when mixed with Rue (Intelligence check to remove all infection from a wound within 5d6 hours, healing an additional 2d6 during the next short rest to whoever the antiseptic is applied to). In addition to its above effects wormwood is also a prime ingredient in a very dangerous, very addictive drink called Absinthe which is milky green in color. X
