A rather robust bush covered with waxy stiff leaves, the Yagdav is prominent in the north, and sometimes used as topiary decoration. During the warmer months the bush grows small yellow flowers. The flower petals are often dried and ground to make a tea that promotes fertility to couples that are having difficulty conceiving. The female is instructed to drink the tea every morning upon first awakening.
