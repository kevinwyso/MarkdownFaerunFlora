Resembling a wild grape in tropical climates, yazur is a small purple berry that can be eaten outright, by anyone but a spellcaster, and tastes like sour apples. If a spellcaster eats yazur berries, the caster will lose a highest-level spell slot until the next long rest. Yazur can also be mashed into a paste with sugar. Applying this paste to any magic object will drain any magic abilities from it, and reverting the object to a normal, non-magical item in the process. If the paste is then eaten after absorbing this magic, it will heal the character to full hit points. In addition, the yazur plant can also be used against spellcasters in a tactical attack. When a spellcaster is directly injected with juice from the berries, all spells that the caster has memorized and prepared for the day will be obliterated from their memory.
