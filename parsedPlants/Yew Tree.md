A tall, evergreen tree found in old growth forests, Yew have long been held sacred by druids as a symbol of death and rebirth, as dropping limbs of older trees will sometimes yield new sprouts. In addition, the yew has come to represent especially death since a poison can be prepared from yew needles and berries if soaked in oil under a full moon (3d6 poison damage to the recipient with no save).
