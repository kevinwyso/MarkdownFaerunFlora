Found in many deserts, the Ylam Tree is a short, stout evergreen that survives on very little amounts of water and maintains its internal moisture using a thick red sap. Imbibing a sufficient quantity of this so-called 'Ylam Blood' or ‘Blood of Glory’ induces a frenzy of aggressive emotions which are especially strong in the heat of battle, leading to a berserk rage. Combatants under the influence of the blood of glory gain a +1 to hit and +2 to damage, but suffer a -3 penalty to armor class, due to the reckless abandon induced by the fluid for 2d6 hours after consumption.
