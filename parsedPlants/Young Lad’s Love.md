Young Lad's Love is a 3 to 5-foot-tall shrub with many branches that resemble small trees. It has small yellow-white flowers, and green feathery leaves, which smell of lemon. These leaves turn a rich orange-brown in late autumn. The flowers should be crushed and placed into a poultice to be used. A successful application will cure one small area of frostbite, such as a foot or hand, in 2d4 hours.
