A rare mushroom that only grows while fully submerged in freshwater, Yuzine is occasionally sought after and harvested by high ranking clergy of Omir and Olim, the Gods of Life and Death respectively. When powdered and combined with holy oil by a trained professional, Yuzine becomes Metabolite, a sort of tranquilizer for the undead. An undead creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. Lasting for 30 seconds on a failed save, an affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted. A creature affected by this poison makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it. On a failed save, the poison's saving throw DC for the next save attempt decreases by 10. Z
